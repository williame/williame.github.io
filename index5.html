    <h2>Compressing 3D Game Models</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>Sometimes I start to write, or at least start to think about writing, computer
                games.  I find the engine writing attractive.  I’m sitting on a few great game ideas; oh to
                have the financial freedom to go be an indie game maker!</p>
                <p>As I start to write the game I find my mind inexplicably drawn by technical details.</p>
                <p>One technical detail that I’m inexplicably drawn to each time is how to compress the
                artwork.  I reckon that games could be <strong>compressed 3x better</strong>:</p>

    <h2>An Eight in a Million chance</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><strong>This is a real story involving consultants, interns and MS Access.</strong></p>
                <p>A very long time ago, as a student - that <em>was</em> a long time ago - I worked
                my summers at British Telecom.  They had this lovely big sprawling labs at Martlesham Heath.</p>
                <p>BT was itself a pretty big sprawling company and projects moved glacially.  Out of this grew a 
                small internal team called ‘FastTrack’ who cut corners and implemented stop-gap IT
                projects while the actual project was being worked on.  I think that was the idea.  It seemed we were
                often doing projects that were just too small for the main IT process and that we were the cowboys.</p>
                <p>One of the mentors that I worked particularly closely with was an old hippy called Simon.  He
                was a really nice bloke and we got along extremely well.  He was not a trained coder; he somehow got
                into coding by solving little computer problems for people.  His tool for this was Microsoft Excel.  And
                his trick was encoding information and state into all the attributes you might have in a cell such as
                colour and border and font and such!  That’s the kind of self-taught hacking that can land you
                a job at a research lab in Suffolk in those days :)  It reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Mel" target="_blank">story of Mel</a>.</p>
                <p>Simon had an especially striking appearance; he was a genuine hippy with long straggly hair and
                a long nail that he chiseled to a flat tip that he called his screwdriver nail.  He was so thin he was
                was skeletal and he smoked roll-ups.  Oh, and he wore a three piece suit.  Striking.  He would often
                clean under his nails with a large lock knife.</p>
                <p>I remember him sitting on the top deck of a red London bus in his three piece suit cleaning his
                nails and telling me tales of a rough childhood in London.  The bus took a sudden turn and he dropped
                this massive lock knife which hit the floor point first and stuck there in the aisle twanging
                menacingly.  I turned around just in time to see the last of our fellow passengers evacuating down the
                stairs.  I felt like a gangster :)  So why was I in London with Simon?  Lets get to that:</p>

    <h2>Cause&#39;s Levenshtein Distance Challenge</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>I hadn’t seen this before, but I bumped into a Python version on the web:
                <a href="https://andothernoise.blogspot.com/2012/01/solving-causes-levenshtein-distance.html" rel="author" target="_blank">Alexandros Marino</a></p>
                <p>His time of 11 seconds - 12 seconds on my laptop - seems a little slow :)</p>
                <p>From the beginning, two things jump out: that he’s using the <em>same</em>
                splices a lot and that he’s using yield.</p>
                <p>So lets tackle the re-use of slices first: if you want the left-part of the current word then
                you can just getting the slice more than once is redudant; simply put b[:i] into a local variable called
                left:</p>
                <p><code>import string<br/>w = set(open(&quot;word.list&quot;).read().splitlines())<br/>f,
                nf = set(), set([&quot;causes&quot;])<br/><br/>#from b, yield all unused words where levdist==1<br/>def
                nextgen(b):<br/>    for i in xrange(len(b)): #for each index in b<br/>        left, ch, at,
                right = b[:i], b[i], b[i:], b[i+1:]<br/>        for c in string.ascii_lowercase: #for letters
                [a..z]<br/>            if c != ch:<br/>                #substitute b[i] with c<br/>               
                x = left + c + right<br/>                if x in w: yield x<br/>                #inject c
                before b[i]<br/>                x = left + c + at<br/>                if x in w: yield x<br/>       
                #remove b[i]<br/>        x = left + right<br/>        if x in w: yield x<br/>   <br/>   
                for c in string.ascii_lowercase: #for letters [a..z]<br/>        x = b + c<br/>        if x
                in w: yield x #append c after b<br/><br/>while len(nf):<br/>    cf = nf<br/>   
                nf = set(j for i in cf for j in nextgen(i) if j not in f)<br/>    w -= nf<br/>    f |= nf<br/><br/>print
                len(f)<br/>assert (len(f) == 78482)</code></p>
                <p>There, runtime down to 9.45 seconds on my laptop.</p>
                <p>Next, lets tackle yield.  If we just put them into a temporary set instead:</p>
                <p><code>f, nf, w = set(), [&quot;causes&quot;], set(open(&quot;word.list&quot;).read().splitlines())<br/><br/>
                def next():<br/>     f = []<br/>     for b in nf:<br/>         for i in range(len(b)):
                #for each index in b<br/>             left, at, right = b[:i], b[i:], b[i+1:]<br/>
                            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':<br/>                 #substitute b[i] with c<br/>
                                x = left + c + right<br/>                 if x in w: f.append(x)<br/>
                                #inject c before b[i]<br/>                 x = left + c + at<br/>
                                if x in w: f.append(x)<br/>             #remove b[i]<br/>             x =
                left + right<br/>             if x in w: f.append(x)<br/>         for c in
                'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':<br/>             x = (b + c)<br/>             if x in w:
                f.append(x) #append c after b<br/>     return set(f)<br/><br/> while nf:<br/>
                    nf = next()<br/>     w -= nf<br/>     f |= nf<br/><br/> print len(f)<br/>
                assert (len(f) == 78482)</code></p>
                <p>Hmm, only a marginal improvement.  Under 9 seconds.</p>
                <p>It would be fun with stackless python or pypy to test out a recursive approach.  But I’m
                not going to zap my daily python for that test!</p>
                <p>With small tweaks, like renaming next(), it runs in shedskin:</p>
                <p><code>    w.difference_update(nf)<br/>    f.update(nf)</code></p>
                <p>Hmm.  22 seconds.  Not going in the right direction :)  I’ll send it in to the
                shedskin list so they can consider how its hurting.</p>

    <h2>How I got massively faster DB with async batching</h2>

                <blockquote>

                things and coalesces things so the DB is getting a few queries each with more payload.</big></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>And I was rather disillusioned with ORMs.</p>
                <p>ORMs are about fast-prototyping code.  However, I discovered - in my DB usage patterns - that
                it was extra development cost when we discovered that the performance cost was prohibitive we had to
                chop it all out and replace it with a custom pattern.  It would have been massively faster development
                to just have done DB asynchronous in the first place…</p>
                <p>What I built is so generally applicable I offer it here as a useful pattern for your projects

                <p>What is particularly exciting is that it runs in Chrome!  There are cravats like it must be the
                latest Chrome Beta and you have to enable NaCl plugins, but as I’ve said before I think NaCl
                is the way of the future.  The game just uses a very neutral intersection of OpenGLES 2 and OpenGL 2 and
                it just works great.  Oh, and we host the in-browser version on github too!  So just point your Chrome

                glDrawElements.  It only does this, as best I can tell, if you have lots of vertices loaded in VBOs. 
                There is no error message.  5 **** hours.  Not happy,  I then waste 2 more hours trying to get mingw to
                cross-compile glew/sdl in a hurry.  I am very very obliged to softcoder from MegaGlest who’s
                stepped in and is helping do that so I can code the actual game instead.</p>

    <h2>Competition: Mini Ludum Dare (21st-22nd Jan 2012) &#34;Fear&#34;</h2>

                and my wife happens to be going on a trip with the kids!  Its like the planets align, or something.</p>
                <p>Sure its only a “mini” LD, a kind of practice, but I think that a practice
                before a first proper LD entry is a good thing!</p>
                <p>I’ve created an account at LD - william_edwards - and I’ve got a ‘jam’
                team together for this weekend.  Its the usual suspect, Mr War, as well as an excellent artist and
                modeler Adrian Delpha, also from the Glest modding community.</p>
                <p>So the “mini” is this weekend, the theme is <em><strong>FEAR</strong></em>,
                and I’ve spent a couple of evenings this week already putting together a 'barebones’
                framework to use.  Here’s a video talking about that and my co-conspirators:</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>After a xmas break - guests do get in the way - it was time to get back to the
                robot!</p>
                <p>To be honest I’ve been putting off etching the motor controller card.  I really don’t
                like the whole idea of playing around with acid and stuff.  My recollections of etching (with crayons)
                from high-school are vague at best so I’m a rank beginner.</p>
                <p>The UV lightbox was, well, a desk lamp with the UV bulb.  Its not at all like the sun-tanning
                beds you see in the pictures.  I pointed it roughly in the direction of the board, and put a
                kitchen-foil-lined box over it to keep me safe.</p>
                <p>My first attempts were a dismal failure.  After 10 minutes exposure there were faint lines
                visible after I put it through 10 minutes of developer.  I didn’t know if this was normal or
                otherwise, so it was onwards to the acid.  Nothing at all came off.  Nothing.  Hmm.  I speculated that
                it was underexposed.</p>
                <p>Back under the light for half an hour, moving the light around slightly a couple of times to
                even it out, and the mask was much more prominent.  Clearly the 3-10 minute guidelines were based on
                fancy light boxes with neat racks of UV tubes :)</p>
                <p>It was very exciting to see the circuit appear after just a few minutes in the acid the second
                time.  However, after a good half hour there was still no budging some copper along to the top edge of
                the board.  I speculate that it was underexposed by the unevenness of my lamp coverage.</p>
                <p>We have a spare board but I’m out of acid.  I think this board can be scratched into
                shape so I’ll try and get it used.</p>
                <p>Now I’ll hand over the card for my co-conspirator to tidy, drill and solder and test.</p>

    <h2>Visualising iPhone Tracking Data</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>A long time ago quite it got quite a bit of press that the iPhone records all your
                location fixes.  In fact, most phones do this.  Anyway, my mate Roy did an<a alt="dead link: http://www.redcode.nl/blog/2011/04/reading-iphone-gps-data-from-backup-with-java/" href="/#404" target="_blank">
                iPhone tracker app in Java</a>.</p>
                <p>I thought that making people download something was quite a high barrier, and it’d be
                much better for people to just drag-n-drop their files onto a webpage…</p>
                <p>I’ve only done HTML when I’ve had to, and the whole new drag-n-drop APIs
                were new to me but I managed to get this working.  However, parsing the btrees in the SQLite databases
                was going to take some learning of Javascript.</p>
                <p>Then I found that a chap called Mark Olson was showing off a Javascript SQLite DB parser
                online.</p>
                <p>So I roped him into helping get a quick drag-n-drop tracker up and running.  The result was
                gorgeous: <em><strong><a href="https://markolson.github.com/js-sqlite-map-thing/" target="_blank">http://markolson.github.com/js-sqlite-map-thing/ </a></strong></em></p>
                <p>It turns out people have no squirms dragging and dropping their private backup files - often
                all their files, and not just picking out the files we ask for even - onto a webpage running code we
                wrote.  Perhaps its naivety.</p>
                <p>However, its hosted on github using the gh-pages system.  And this makes for a <em><strong>very
                interesting security angle</strong></em>.  Assuming that github themselves are honest, and
                that your Internet connection is not being fiddled with (its HTTP but really do you trust HTTPS these
                days anyway?), the full <em>change-history</em> of what we are asking you to run is public.</p>
                <p>I imagine the tracking is better secured these days - I’d be surprised if the iPhone
                has stopped recording the data, but I’d also be surprised if it was as easily accessible. 
                Despite this, the web-page is still getting a steady stream of visitors.</p>

    <h2>OpenGLES I want my GL_QUADS back :(</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>The minimalism of OpenGLES2 is beginning to bug me.  I know too much about mechanical
                sympathy and graphics to completely see eye-to-eye with the architecture astronauts that the companies
                send to Khronos meetings just to get them away from the people who can do real work ;)</p>
                <p>I have two approaches you can take when porting existing, working OpenGL code to OpenGLES2
                whilst trying to have a common-as-possible codebase that targets all the OpenGL flavours:</p>
                <ol><li>Rewrite things to use attribute arrays and OpenGLES2-supported calls and it will
                mostly work on the newer, other OpenGL flavours.  Stuck trying to run the same code on Windows with
                OpenGL 1.1 is not so fun though</li>
                <li>Write a mapping layer</li>
                </ol><p>As it is I started on (2) but have ended up doing (1).  (1) is less effort time-wise
                for me than (2), but if (2) already existed then it would be the clear winner.  Does such a useful
                mapping already exist?</p>
                <p>You could imagine a mapping layer that stored all the glVertex() calls in an array and punched
                out a modern call when you do the glEnd().  And likewise storing all the various client-side state in,
                guess what, client-side variables and so on.  You could imagine it being like GLEW but loading OpenGL
                dynamically at runtime and so exposing classic superset of all supported OpenGL that it then maps to the
                target.</p>
                <p>Myself my code is all VBOs but glVertexPointer etc don’t exist on OpenGLES2.  And
                they don’t seem to have anything like hand-holding of interleaving arrays, meaning when I
                interleave my arrays myself.</p>
                <p>Oh the pain!</p>
                <p>Its like they don’t want to have any sensible migration path for existing code.  They
                put so many small barriers to cheap migrating that in the end it adds up to a massive hurdle.  Its about
                as much hassle to move to OpenGLES2 as to move to DirectX11 instead.</p>
                <p>Of all the things missing in OpenGLES2 its GL_QUADS that irritates and inconveniences me most. 
                All my font glyths and particle effects and some game tiles are GL_QUADS and I can’t think of
                a good reason for not supporting them.  It really grates to be duplicating a couple of vertices for each
                quad when targeting precisely the most memory-constrained target.  I guess in the end its no big deal,
                but it just feels wrong.</p>
                <p>Its all too easy to imagine the architecture astronauts sitting around a table saying ‘well
                you can make a quad from two triangles, and sometimes if they aren’t on a plane you want to
                control the fold anyway, so lets get rid of yet another primitive!’.  I guess I’m
                bitter and cynical about design-by-committee.</p>
                <p>What possible justification can there be for not having GL_QUADS?  If there’s some
                mechanical antipathy, I want it explained!</p>

    <h2>Buffcacher</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>What should a ‘cache’ be? It means a lot of things, but to my
                mind the default programming type should be:</p>
                <p><big>“<em>keep around expensive-to-generate bits of read-only data in
                case we need them again, or until the computer really needs that RAM for something else</em>”</big></p>
                <p>I was writing a custom video editing program in Python (interesting choice of language for that
                problem) and I wanted to cache decoded frames; but I just wasn’t happy with the memory
                management of explicit caches.  It means making a decision about how much RAM to ring-fence for
                something without having global system knowledge.</p>
                <p>The problem with most caching systems is they aren’t elastic and they don’t
                dynamically reflect the demands of other applications you are sharing a computer with.  Additionally, in
                my case, I wanted it to work multi-process too.</p>
                <p>Python has weak references but they are something else; you have to keep a strong reference to
                something to keep it around.</p>
                <p>Java has soft references for caching purposes but they are objects living in the small bit of
                your RAM assigned to your JVM.</p>
                <p>My inspiration was the <em><strong>Operating System File System’s “Buffer
                Cache”</strong></em>:</p>
                <p>All mainstream OSes have much the same strategy - unused pages of RAM are used to cache disk IO
                automatically. If your application is reading and/or writing to the same bits of a file, its likely
                getting reads back straight from the OS 'buffer cache’ without hitting disk. And this happens
                much more than you think, since all the code and libraries are, at this level, just files too.</p>
                <p>Imagine you could share that buffer cache?  Imagine you could write data that the <em>kernel</em>
                only kept around if it didn’t have a better use for it?  And imagine you could share the reads
                and writes between processes too if you wanted?  And the kernel had a way of managing permissions,
                locking and sharing.</p>
                <p>So I made a quick and dirty filesystem to (ab)use the OS VM system for the caching of arbitrary
                objects without them writing through to file. As the buffer cache sits in front of the filesystem, the
                filesystem’s reading and writing can look like this:</p>
                <pre><code>int read(file*, offset, length, bytes*):
                return -EIO; # report an error
                int write(file*, offset, length, bytes*):
                return length; # report success, but don't store the bytes anywhere</code></pre>
                <p>Now its a case of tracking where you have written your cached items to in some file on this
                filesystem, and if your reading back of the cached value at some later time succeeds, those bytes were
                read from the OS’s cached pages!</p>
                <p>In this way its easy to cache items in the OS and let them compete for free RAM with the IO
                pages. As caching is diminishing returns, there’s likely plenty of free RAM to store the hot
                IO and these cached values, with the remainder of free RAM churning with the speculative storing of
                soon-discarded cold pages of things.</p>
                <p>It would be a worthwhile finesse to regularly sort popular small items to be near to each
                sharing pages, but I took the easy way out and aligned all items on page boundaries; after all,
                uncompressed video frames are several pages each anyway.</p>
                <p>I used FUSE to get this working. But it was quite slow. Unfair to say was <em>extremely</em>
                slow, since, it was <strong><em>faster</em></strong> than <strong>memcached</strong>
                running on the same machine :)</p>
                <p>But <em><strong>imagine a kernel module filesystem</strong></em> to do
                this… that’d be blazingly fast. The key lookup could be inside the kernel too; I
                could imagine a lookup being a dreaded <code>ioctl</code> that returned the file offset and
                length of items or reserved for storing new items. And if the read hits the filesystem callback, it
                could check to see if its a miss or if the filesystem itself explicitly evicted the value since it has
                been replaced by another value in since the offset/length was fetched with the ioctl; in this way,
                multiple users could use the same store (perfect for forking and other cooperative things; what would
                your gnome or KDE want to cache that wasn’t naturally a file?). <em>How fast</em>
                might a kernel module be? Its the same as a RAM disk, basically. That’s <em>fast</em>
                :)</p>
                <p>You could go further; if you are using some <strong>NoSQL</strong> server, or even
                memcached, you likely have it on another node. As sets are a fraction of the gets, you could have a
                single thread on each client that listens to the NoSQL server for the hashcodes of set keys, and invokes
                some ioctl that invalidates them in the common cache. This way, all your redis or whatever reads on each
                of your webserver nodes could be cached locally.</p>
                <p>Or you could take a classic cache like memcached, that itself could use buffcacher instead of
                doing its own eviction policy and using a static amount of resources on each node.</p>
                <p>I wish that all operating systems had a straightforward, even standardised, way to cache data
                in  a dynamic way.  And I wish that all programming languages came with standard libraries to utilise
                it.</p>
                <p>Whilst programs are not particularly getting larger, the data they act upon is.  The future
                will be full of data, and it’ll be increasingly important to compress that data on storage, as
                storage is not getting faster even as it gets bigger.</p>
                <p>I philosophised on whether my buffercacher is the first step towards proper explicit OS support
                for this; after reflection I decided that yes, <em>files</em> are good abstraction for
                this.  The OS doesn’t need to learn new tricks, it just needs a file system that is
                forgetful.  A good library can do the rest.  Just as long as its installed by default ;)</p>
                <p><strong>Your browser probably reserves 60% or so of your RAM</strong> just to fill
                up with pages you’ve visited or might soon visit.  (There’s so much wrong with that
                statement but its true <em>in spirit</em>.)  This is because there isn’t a
                system-wide caching system it can use.  It ought to be using buffcacher!</p>

                launchable; I mean that we’d look in your address book, recognise it, and show the person’s

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>A while ago, I was playing with computing line-of-sight for game-like heightmap
                terrain.  I wanted to efficiently compute which tiles in it were visible from an eye at any given
                location and height.</p>
                <p><a alt="dead link: http://web.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/publications/artigo_1999_efficient_lineofsight_algorithms.pdf" href="/#404" rel="nofollow">http://web.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/publications/artigo_1999_efficient_lineofsight_algorithms.pdf</a>
                suggested that heightmaps outperform turning the terrain into some kind of mesh, but they sample the
                grid using Bresenhams.</p>
                <p>If I were to adopt that, I’d have to do a line-of-sight Bresenham’s line
                for each and every tile on the map. It occurred to me that it ought to be possible to reuse most of the
                calculations and compute the heightmap in a single pass if you fill outwards away from the eye - a
                scanline fill kind of approach perhaps?</p>
                <p>Here is the O(n) sweep that I came up with; I seems the same as that given in the <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.3639&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper
                by Franklin and Ray</a>, only in this case I am walking from eye outwards instead of walking the
                perimeter doing a Bresenham towards the centre; to my mind, my approach would have much better caching
                behaviour - i.e. be faster - and use less memory since it doesn’t have to track the vector for
                each tile, only remember a scanline’s worth:</p>
                <pre><code>typedef std::vector&lt;float&gt; visbuf_t;

                inline void map::_visibility_scan(const visbuf_t&amp; in,visbuf_t&amp; out,const vec_t&amp;
                eye,int start_x,int stop_x,int y,int prev_y) {
                const int xdir = (start_x &lt; stop_x)? 1: -1;
                for(int x=start_x; x!=stop_x; x+=xdir) {

                const bool horiz = (x_diff &gt;= y_diff);
                const int x_step = horiz? 1: x_diff/y_diff;
                const int in_x = x-x_step*xdir; // where in the in buffer would we get the inner value?

    <h2>Network Transparency and Multi-Root Filesystems</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><div><span>I published this short article to an hobby OS site in 2004.  I don’t
                think the idea has aged a bit!</span><br/><br/>This article offers feature suggestions
                to budding OS developers looking for that neat edge.
                <p>Wouldn’t it be real nice if <code>FILE *f =
                fopen(&quot;ftp://www.microsoft.com/mission/statement.html&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);</code> just worked?</p>
                <p>People have been dreaming of ‘mounting’ remote filesystems on demand for a
                long time. It seems to be a popular pastime for <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000041.html" rel="nofollow"> architecture
                astronauts</a>. Despite Joel’s warnings to run from network transparency, I vote that
                you don’t!</p>
                <p>Client-side libraries allow a program to access remote resources in the same way as local ones,
                for example the excellent <a alt="dead link: http://www.gnu.org/directory/libs/libferris.html" href="/#404" rel="nofollow">libferris</a>.</p>
                <p>A new operating system that integrated such handling into the platform level (rather than an
                additional, optional library) would have the advantage that each and every application could access the
                same resources. The 'ls’ in the ported bash prompt would be able to list the contents of an
                FTP directory, and the notepad clone would load your text files whether they were local, on some window
                server, or the other side of the internet.</p>
                <p>Users work with and are familiar with URIs, so URIs are the natural way of expressing a file
                name and location. The filesystem ought to work with URIs.</p>
                <p>Imagine the following snippet of fictious commandline:</p>
                <pre>&gt; pwd<br/>file:///home/me/<br/>&gt; cd <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; cd mission<br/>&gt;
                ls<br/>. .. statement.html<br/>&gt; rm mission.html<br/>access denied.</pre>
                <p>The use of URIs introduces what I term the ’<strong>Multi-Root Filesystem</strong>’.
                The protocol, e.g. “file”, “smb” or “webdav”,
                is a root. All protocols are peers of each other, and you can’t navigate between them in
                relative paths (i.e. no “file://home/me/../../../http://remote”).</p>
                <p>Protocol handlers are global to the user or system. The file structure might be made upon
                demand, with the contents of “http://” reading like recent internet history; whereas
                “file://” might countain the local UNIX-style root “/” which
                contains in-turn “home” and “bin” etc.</p>
                <p>Provide your system with a new protocol handler and suddenly all applications can use files
                available via that mechanism.</p>
                <p>Obviously opening a file over ftp is possibly a million miles more complicated than opening a
                local file. When allowing the same API to be used to access both local and remote file-like resources,
                things that rarely go wrong on local operations (such as takes a long time, might fail) happen a lot
                more often. That the average programmer never checks that things fail/succeed and always putting IO into
                the UI thread is just plain bad, for both local and remote resources. It would have to be thought about.
                Massively multi-threaded message-passing operating systems might have the edge in this respect.</p>
                <p>A unified, transparent network access for many protocols does not remove the need for dedicated
                protocol handling libraries for specialist programs. But it does make the average program suddenly much
                more powerful and useful to the average user!</p>
                <p>It is worth mentioning an additional feature for the interested OS developer to research:
                auto-mounting archives and encrypted files transparently, e.g. “sftp://www.mycom.org/mail/archives/2004-07.zip.pgp/get
                rich quick.msg”.</p>

    <h2>Openning Streams by MIME-type</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><span>Back in 2004 I published this on an OS hobby site.  I never heard of any
                hobbyists actually doing anything I suggested conceptually.</span><br/><br/>This
                article offers feature suggestions to budding OS developers looking for that neat edge. This osnews
                mini-series is a series to give people developing hobby operating systems - for fun - ideas that take
                their OS from a kernel to a ‘system’.</p>
                <p>In previous articles we have described using URIs [1] for file paths and the idea that streams
                of various types can be transparently converted between by the operating system [2]. This article
                describes how these might be unified into a single, consistent user interface.</p>

                <img alt="Opening Streams" border="0" height="307" src="https://sites.google.com/site/williamedwardscoder/_/rsrc/1279396222293/streams.jpg?height=307&amp;width=495" width="495"/><p>UNIX has the design principle that 'everything is a file’ [3]. A file
                is, more properly, a stream. I have introduced, in the previous article, the idea that a stream, if we
                know its type, might be presented transparently to a program as another, compatible type. This means
                that conceptually a file is in fact many streams, with each stream marked by type [4].</p>
                <p>Streams don’t just refer to physical files on your computer or remote computers.
                Streams can be generated by other things such as applications and device drivers. In UNIX, named pipes
                and UNIX-domain sockets provide this kind of facility [5].</p>
                <p>Many UNIX programs are an excellent example of applications that provide streams
                programmatically. The 'sort’ command takes one stream as input and outputs to another, as does
                the 'grep’ command. In fact, all command line programs do this. As our hobby operating system
                is marking streams by type, you could expect all these command line applications to be reading and
                writing text/plain streams. If you want to 'grep’ on a rich document, for example, the
                operating system would be quite capable of converting that to text/plain - if the virtual file system
                has the right plug-in - and 'grep’ need not know [6].</p>
                <p>We’ll make the jump that your hobby OS includes a GUI of sorts! How might
                applications provide streams for the user to interact with?</p>
                <p>GUI widgets (windows, even individual controls such as text boxes) might report to the system
                that they provide/consume streams of certain mime-types. This would allow the window manager to provide
                drag-n-drop stream connections and work as a versatile clip-board. This is not so strange - this is
                pretty much what the windows clipboard is doing anyway!</p>
                <p>So think of 'open’ and 'save’ as reading and writing streams, rather than
                files (a slightly thin distinction to make, I know). Applications conventionally use standard system
                dialogs for allowing the user to select files to open and names of files to save-as. This allows the
                hobby operating system author to unify application streams, remote streams and file streams and present
                them to the user in a sensible manner.</p>
                <p>You’ll see from my dialog mockup that I allow the user to select from a recent
                streams history, from a location (much like a conventional file-open dialog) and by type. This later
                category is something akin to a search. Popular consensus in the human-computer-interaction camp at the
                moment seems to think that users don’t really remember where they put files or what they are
                called. Modern operating systems such as BeOS, Windows and the like are moving in the direction of
                letting the user search for files instead. This is the whole big idea behind the 'file system is a
                database’ hype at the moment!</p>
                <p>So the user doesn’t care where the stream comes from, they care only that they find
                their stream. The 'by type’ presents all files of the appropriate type, regardless of
                location. In the example dialog an application-provided stream is shown highlighted, mixed in with
                streams provided by conventional files from the user’s home directory.</p>
                <p>A 'by type’ query that is constantly updating live is termed an 'active query’
                and is one of the many big features in BeOS. The idea is that, while you have a search window open,
                files that are added, modified or removed that fit the terms of the query are automatically updated [7].</p>
                <p>The Save-As dialog might also present application streams as valid destinations. A user might
                'save’ a bitmap to their presentation software which is running at the moment, and that
                presentation software might insert that received image file into the actively-being-edited application.</p>
                <p>Opening a stream is assisted by search agents. The idea is that various mime-types might
                register search agents that take words, phrases or even complex query expressions and filter a list
                based upon user-entered criteria. You might want to only documents that contain a reference to a certain
                activity, for example. Various search agents might use meta-data, a contextual search or an index to
                find matches; it depends upon the mime-type and the agent’s needs.</p>
                <p>It could be taken further and integrate search agents that represent remote locations e.g.
                coalescing a Google search into a local files search.</p>
