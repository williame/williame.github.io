                <p>Then came 5 or so hours of frustration trying to get NaCl to not hang mysteriously when loading
                Mr War’s simple animations.  After buckets of printf debugging, and discovering that
                std::string treats nulls very slightly differently in cout/cerr on NaCl (!!), I track the hanging to
                glDrawElements.  It only does this, as best I can tell, if you have lots of vertices loaded in VBOs. 
                There is no error message.  5 **** hours.  Not happy,  I then waste 2 more hours trying to get mingw to
                cross-compile glew/sdl in a hurry.  I am very very obliged to softcoder from MegaGlest who’s
                stepped in and is helping do that so I can code the actual game instead.</p>
                <p>And so, with only about 2 hours actual coding, here’s where we are right now:</p>

                and my wife happens to be going on a trip with the kids!  Its like the planets align, or something.</p>
                <p>Sure its only a “mini” LD, a kind of practice, but I think that a practice
                before a first proper LD entry is a good thing!</p>
                <p>I’ve created an account at LD - william_edwards - and I’ve got a ‘jam’
                team together for this weekend.  Its the usual suspect, Mr War, as well as an excellent artist and
                modeler Adrian Delpha, also from the Glest modding community.</p>
                <p>So the “mini” is this weekend, the theme is <em><strong>FEAR</strong></em>,
                and I’ve spent a couple of evenings this week already putting together a 'barebones’
                framework to use.  Here’s a video talking about that and my co-conspirators:</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>After a xmas break - guests do get in the way - it was time to get back to the
                robot!</p>
                <p>To be honest I’ve been putting off etching the motor controller card.  I really don’t
                like the whole idea of playing around with acid and stuff.  My recollections of etching (with crayons)
                from high-school are vague at best so I’m a rank beginner.</p>
                <p>The UV lightbox was, well, a desk lamp with the UV bulb.  Its not at all like the sun-tanning
                beds you see in the pictures.  I pointed it roughly in the direction of the board, and put a
                kitchen-foil-lined box over it to keep me safe.</p>
                <p>My first attempts were a dismal failure.  After 10 minutes exposure there were faint lines
                visible after I put it through 10 minutes of developer.  I didn’t know if this was normal or
                otherwise, so it was onwards to the acid.  Nothing at all came off.  Nothing.  Hmm.  I speculated that
                it was underexposed.</p>
                <p>Back under the light for half an hour, moving the light around slightly a couple of times to
                even it out, and the mask was much more prominent.  Clearly the 3-10 minute guidelines were based on
                fancy light boxes with neat racks of UV tubes :)</p>
                <p>It was very exciting to see the circuit appear after just a few minutes in the acid the second
                time.  However, after a good half hour there was still no budging some copper along to the top edge of
                the board.  I speculate that it was underexposed by the unevenness of my lamp coverage.</p>
                <p>We have a spare board but I’m out of acid.  I think this board can be scratched into
                shape so I’ll try and get it used.</p>
                <p>Now I’ll hand over the card for my co-conspirator to tidy, drill and solder and test.</p>

</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>The minimalism of OpenGLES2 is beginning to bug me.  I know too much about mechanical
                sympathy and graphics to completely see eye-to-eye with the architecture astronauts that the companies
                send to Khronos meetings just to get them away from the people who can do real work ;)</p>
                <p>I have two approaches you can take when porting existing, working OpenGL code to OpenGLES2
                whilst trying to have a common-as-possible codebase that targets all the OpenGL flavours:</p>
                <ol><li>Rewrite things to use attribute arrays and OpenGLES2-supported calls and it will
                mostly work on the newer, other OpenGL flavours.  Stuck trying to run the same code on Windows with
                OpenGL 1.1 is not so fun though</li>
                <li>Write a mapping layer</li>
                </ol><p>As it is I started on (2) but have ended up doing (1).  (1) is less effort time-wise
                for me than (2), but if (2) already existed then it would be the clear winner.  Does such a useful
                mapping already exist?</p>
                <p>You could imagine a mapping layer that stored all the glVertex() calls in an array and punched
                out a modern call when you do the glEnd().  And likewise storing all the various client-side state in,
                guess what, client-side variables and so on.  You could imagine it being like GLEW but loading OpenGL
                dynamically at runtime and so exposing classic superset of all supported OpenGL that it then maps to the
                target.</p>
                <p>Myself my code is all VBOs but glVertexPointer etc don’t exist on OpenGLES2.  And
                they don’t seem to have anything like hand-holding of interleaving arrays, meaning when I
                interleave my arrays myself.</p>
                <p>Oh the pain!</p>
                <p>Its like they don’t want to have any sensible migration path for existing code.  They
                put so many small barriers to cheap migrating that in the end it adds up to a massive hurdle.  Its about
                as much hassle to move to OpenGLES2 as to move to DirectX11 instead.</p>
                <p>Of all the things missing in OpenGLES2 its GL_QUADS that irritates and inconveniences me most. 
                All my font glyths and particle effects and some game tiles are GL_QUADS and I can’t think of
                a good reason for not supporting them.  It really grates to be duplicating a couple of vertices for each
                quad when targeting precisely the most memory-constrained target.  I guess in the end its no big deal,
                but it just feels wrong.</p>
                <p>Its all too easy to imagine the architecture astronauts sitting around a table saying ‘well
                you can make a quad from two triangles, and sometimes if they aren’t on a plane you want to
                control the fold anyway, so lets get rid of yet another primitive!’.  I guess I’m
                bitter and cynical about design-by-committee.</p>
                <p>What possible justification can there be for not having GL_QUADS?  If there’s some
                mechanical antipathy, I want it explained!</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>A while ago, I was playing with computing line-of-sight for game-like heightmap
                terrain.  I wanted to efficiently compute which tiles in it were visible from an eye at any given
                location and height.</p>
                <p><a alt="dead link: http://web.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/publications/artigo_1999_efficient_lineofsight_algorithms.pdf" href="/#404" rel="nofollow">http://web.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/publications/artigo_1999_efficient_lineofsight_algorithms.pdf</a>
                suggested that heightmaps outperform turning the terrain into some kind of mesh, but they sample the
                grid using Bresenhams.</p>
                <p>If I were to adopt that, I’d have to do a line-of-sight Bresenham’s line
                for each and every tile on the map. It occurred to me that it ought to be possible to reuse most of the
                calculations and compute the heightmap in a single pass if you fill outwards away from the eye - a
                scanline fill kind of approach perhaps?</p>
                <p>Here is the O(n) sweep that I came up with; I seems the same as that given in the <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.3639&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper
                by Franklin and Ray</a>, only in this case I am walking from eye outwards instead of walking the
                perimeter doing a Bresenham towards the centre; to my mind, my approach would have much better caching
                behaviour - i.e. be faster - and use less memory since it doesn’t have to track the vector for
                each tile, only remember a scanline’s worth:</p>

                <p>I wanted a nice cartoony fluffy clouds and bobbly trees, but all those spheres were taking just
                too many polygons.</p>
                <p>The solution I prototyped was to bill-board spheres… complete with depth.</p>
                <p>The billboard image was actually a depth-map.  I was using a special value to indicate no texel
                and do a discard in the fragment shader.</p>
                <p>To get nice edges on the spheres I did it in two passes; first pass, draw all opaque texels
                inside the circle of the billboard, setting depth; second pass, draw all semi-transparent texels on the
                edges of the spheres without setting depth (i.e. its at billboard depth).</p>
                <p>I found that I could draw almost a thousand such spheres at a good enough framerate on the
                worst cards.  On more average ATI and NVidia cards the framerate was nicely in the hundreds.  So this is
                a very efficient technique.</p>
                <p>Shadows can be done by sampling the depth buffer in a second pass and using a 1D texture that
                is the cross-section of the sphere.  I didn’t prototype that bit; its an exercise for the
                dedicated reader ;)</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>We finally might have found some paper we can use to transfer laser<br/> toner
                to PCBs!<br/><br/> We’ve been exhaustively testing various glossy magazine and
                brochures<br/> and things and its proved hard to find paper that feeds properly<br/> through
                our printer; we’ve had the printer apart in ways you won’t<br/> find in the
                handbook trying to find missing incriminating pages.<br/><br/> Taping these pages to proper
                A4 paper in the hope it’d feed better<br/> turned out to be a big mistake.  Massive
                mistake.  But the printer<br/> works again now so that’ll be our secret.<br/><br/>
                The only success we’ve had is to print out the mask onto some 15yo<br/> deskjet photo
                paper and quickly iron it onto the board.  Then we soak<br/> it for a few minutes in water and
                then rub the paper off with our<br/> thumbs.  We’ve been testing with normal kitchen
                foil, and hope that it<br/> works as well on proper board.<br/><br/> There are people
                on the internet who claim to have adapted laser<br/> printers to feed flat sheet PCB through
                directly, and then they chuck<br/> it in a warm oven for a few minutes to ensure its properly
                fused.  We<br/> had started to think along those lines, although I rather imagine a<br/>
                lego mindstorms printer - or laser etcher - being a more fun build<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX09WnGU6ZY" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX09WnGU6ZY</a>
                .  Of course a proper UV<br/> light box would be easier that that route.<br/><br/>
                Ironing seems strangely pleasingly amateurish.</p>

                <div>A while back I was interested in how you might lay out a road.  I’d been looking at
                classic tile-based games like simcity and I wanted to get away from tiles.</div>
                <br/>
                <div>If you lay out a path and the road takes a sweeping hermite spline then it feels just plain
                wrong.</div>
                <br/>
                <div>I got much better results from treating each joint as a circle and joining up the tangents of
                adjacent joints.</div>
                <br/><div>I thought you can get very nice tiling of the road/train-track/whatever if you use
                a texture atlas where the tiles are arranged vertically, letting you use GL_REPEAT on the horizontal.
                 You then generate a quad strip without needing to divide long straights into too many quads whilst
                still having the option of a bit of variety and such.</div>

                co-conspirators and go robot supplies shopping.<br/><br/> It didn’t quite go as
                planned with the ironing-on masking approach;<br/> sadly our nearby shop that sells board and such
                - Kjell&amp;Co - has<br/> stopped stocking the plain copper ones and now only the UV-sensitive<br/>
                ones are available.  And it seemed a shame to have to clean off the UV<br/> layer and iron-on our
                mask, so we opted to splash out on a UV lamp<br/> instead.  We also got the acid, developer and
                other bits and pieces<br/> like lunch-boxes to put the acid in and so on.<br/><br/> We
                printed the mask out onto overhead film.  Two copies, to make sure<br/> its definitely dark
                enough.<br/><br/> The plan is to make the some simple test exposures to get the timing<br/>
                right and such, and then develop the H-bridge board.  Once that’s been<br/> soldered and
                is controlling some simple lamps it’ll be time to think<br/> about joining our ARM chip
                board to it.<br/><br/> Its going to be a smelly weekend with the acid</p>
