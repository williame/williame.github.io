                been a bit in the spotlight recently.</p>
                <p>There has been a natural progression in the blogosphere as it tracks <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/" target="_blank">LinkedIn’s
                shame</a>.  Yes you should use a password hash function with integrated salting e.g. bcrypt or
                scrypt.  Yes its scary reading developers comment as they fuddle through trying to invent their own
                solution in the comments to stories.</p>
                <p>And that blogosphere progression has now reached 2-factor authentication.  This just slipped in
                from an expert (who downplayed salt; yes, stretching is critical, but you would be crazy to stretch
                without salting too):</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>But the real answer is things like two-factor authentication with smart phones. Two factor
                authentication seems like the answer to me. I think ten years from now this is going to be a common
                approach. [<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/06/how-companies-can-beef-up-password-security/" target="_blank">Thomas H. Ptacek</a>]</p>

                <p>Its a step in the right direction of course.  But a chain is as weak as the weakest link and

    <h2>How to make a Text Adventure</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>UPDATE: there’s now a beautifully-illustrated<strong> <a href="https://williame.github.com/ludum_dare_23_tiny_world_post_compo/background1_cheat.jpg" target="_blank">cheat-sheet</a> f</strong>or <a href="https://williame.github.com/ludum_dare_23_tiny_world_post_compo/" target="_blank">our
                text-adventure</a>!</p>
                <p>Text Adventures are excellent mental exercise to write!  They are useful for learning to
                program; they are equally useful for seasoned programmers to refresh and recuperate on!  They can fit
                anywhere on a sliding scale between straightforward and high-end CS-research, and the programmer can
                slide their game anywhere up and down that scale at whim.  And they are fun :)<br/><br/>Text
                Adventures are out of fashion though.  This <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&amp;uid=10313" target="_blank">Ludum
                Dare</a> we decided to resurrect the Text Adventure and this is a description of the approach we

</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>And the theme is “<strong>Tiny World</strong>”.</p>
                <p>To be honest, I’m a bit stumped.  Teammates will be arriving on-line soon and I don’t
                have much concrete overarching vision for this theme, which was my job and why I got up at 3am.</p>
                <p>I really want to stay away from actually making a platform game where the map is circular and
                smallish.</p>
                <p>So, in the text adventure vein:</p>
                <ul><li>is it that the obligatory mad professor has built a microscope instead of
                telescope?  That he is building mechanical brass-cog nano-bots?  That they are slowly transforming the
                world as you break the puzzles?</li>
                <li>is it that everyone knows everyone else?  That there’s some secret (treasure) that
                increasingly silly teams of people keep turning up to recover, and you have to outsmart them all?  When
                a vicar and his wife arrive, followed by some Sioux in a canoe, and everyone seems to know everyone else
                and the pirates are on first name terms with everyone except the swiss mountaineer whom they have
                previously had a disagreement with, then you can say it truly is <a alt="dead link: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/it%27s+a+small+world" href="/#404" target="_blank">a small world</a>?</li>
                <li>And what’s the world called?  Aardvark would be a strategic name from an
                alphabetical sorting perspective ;)</li>
                </ul><p>All ideas welcome!</p>

                <p>Back in the summer of 2009 a friend of mine read a few of <a href="post/19794076450.html" target="_blank">my
                books</a> covering cryptography.</p>
                <p>This is his interpretation of the <a alt="dead link: http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/machines.rhtm" href="/#404" target="_blank">Enigma cipher machine</a>;
                the distillation of a mental model he formed from reading those popular-science treatments of the
                machine.</p>
                <p>He is <em>not</em> a programmer or anything but he just proved his aptitude; and he’s
                super-<em>leet</em> at Excel too!</p>
                <p>I think we can all agree this <em>is</em> programming, even when done by someone
                who is not a professional programmer and who has no formal programming education.</p>
                <p>When I asked him if I could post his old Enigma spreadsheet, he was skeptical that anyone would
                be interested.  Outside the programming world, normal people think making complicated spreadsheets in
                their spare time is creepy and to be suppressed ;)</p>
                <p>Now the Internet is awash with Engima machines in Flash applets and such; none seem to agree
                with any other, and this spreadsheet is no exception to that.  So it would be most unlikely this is a
                truly accurate representation of the real machine.</p>
                <p>However, my friend is a good visual learner; I think if we could just get him to <a alt="dead link: http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/" href="/#404" target="_blank">Bletchley Park</a> he’d

    <h2>My tech-savvy Generation</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>My two girls - 3 and 5 - got a computer for Christmas!  Its just an old desktop
                running <a href="http://www.qimo4kids.com/" target="_blank">Qimo</a> but it is theirs and
                they’re thrilled.</p>
                <p>I haven’t shown them how to do anything; they have worked everything out for
                themselves.  Early on, though, I realised how fun and instructive it was to pay attention to what they
                had worked out and how; they were building little mental models of how computers work.</p>
                <p>One of their favourite programs is <a href="http://tuxpaint.org/" target="_blank">TuxPaint</a>. 
                It is a nice painting program for kids.  In it there is a button that creates a new picture.  As it does
                so, it asks you if you want to save your current picture.  The girls had been clicking the ‘yes’
                button (not that they can read the button text at all; just from trial and error they know the green
                button takes them forwards).</p>
                <p><img height="120" src="http://tuxpaint.org/screenshots/starter-coloringbook-t.png" width="160"/><img height="120" src="http://tuxpaint.org/screenshots/dialog_saveover-t.png" width="160"/><img height="120" src="http://tuxpaint.org/screenshots/dialog_open-t.png" width="160"/></p>
                <p>The other day they discovered a button that lets them load a saved picture; so, clicking on it,
                they saw an archive of every picture they had ever done!</p>
                <p>I didn’t witness this, but I’d have loved to see their faces.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I did look in on them a while later.  And they were systematically opening each saved
                picture… <em>and erasing it</em>.   I asked them why…</p>
                <p><em><strong>So they could reuse the paper</strong></em>, they said.</p>

                <p>Most normal corporate database web apps are either blazingly fast or blazingly slow at the five

                they are blazingly slow.</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><ul><li>Deeply technical stories might get up to about 5K visitors from  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news" target="_blank">HackerNews</a> (“HN”)
                and 10K from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming" target="_blank">reddit/r/programming</a>

                -type posts still get under 10K from HN, but can get 40K+ from proggit</li>
                <li>Hacker News is a much stabler community; if you have posted stories in succession, the same
                5K+ visitors coming back each time</li>
                <li>Reddit is a flash crowd; they claim 350K+ subscribers, but that number doesn’t mean
                much; very few clickers on any given story are repeat</li>
                <li>If a story gets on the front page of both at the same time, you get might get more people from
                HN than proggit</li>
                <li>But the story dies a lot sooner on HackerNews; proggit can keep people streaming in for a
                whole day</li>
                <li>Being very top spot on HN is a dramatic visit booster; you can watch in Google Analytics Real
                Time the sudden influx of visitors when you get sorted to top; and then a trickle again as you drop to
                second place; Google Analytics Real Time is gamification for blogging</li>
                <li>Google Analytics doesn’t count people using <a href="https://noscript.net/" target="_blank">noscript</a> (when there are so many <a href="https://samy.pl/evercookie/" target="_blank">technical</a> avenues they could pursue instead)</li>
                </ul><p>Very very few people who read a blog post go back to the link aggregation site and
                vote on it:</p>
                <ul><li>About 100 to 1 visitors to points seems about right; if a story has 100 points, its
                likely 10K people read it.  That’s right;<em> two orders of magnitude</em>!</li>
                <li><em>West coasters up-vote less than Europeans</em>; maybe they are busier?  Or my
                content is more pleasing to Europeans?</li>
                <li>The per-page time is actually quite high; often over 5 minutes on average for a lot of my
                stories even when its a big crowd.  I suspect some subtle misreading of Google Analytics on my part, or
                else people might actually be reading the whole thing carefully!?</li>
                <li>I speculate that most HN readers are not actually logged in</li>
                </ul><p>Most compliments are never given:</p>
                <ul><li>If someone likes a post, they probably say nothing</li>
                <li>A comment on the blog is going to be very polite and constructive</li>
                <li>A comment on HN is going to be mature and reasoned; often expanding or exploring technical
                issues raised</li>
                <li>People comment on proggit to complain about a story</li>
                <li>Never bother mentioning Haskell.  That crowd has this circular argument going ;)</li>
                </ul><p>Its lovely to read the tweets:</p>
                <ul><li><strong>A tweet is the biggest compliment of all</strong>; 140 chars to
                summarise the post really makes it obvious that the tweeter groks it; and its almost never negative</li>
                <li>Nobody actually follows the links in tweets though; click-through is often in the low digits
                per tweet</li>
                </ul><p>This is like search-engine-optimisation; now go shower!</p>
                <ul><li>The ideal proggit time is Sunday daytime in the states; it gets to the top for
                Europe’s Monday, and is still up there for stateside Monday</li>
                <li>The ideal HN time is a weekday European afternoon; discerning European votes can get the post
                onto the front page in time for a stateside morning</li>
                <li>Proggit, stories get stuck in spam filters.  Then it often gets mercilessly down-voted by
                people not leaving comments and so it dies</li>
                <li>On HN, stories start in the ’<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newest" target="_blank">newest</a>’ fire-hose; the click rate here is in the low double
                digits, but these early-clickers are far more likely to go back and up-vote, so a story can gather the 3
                or 5 votes it needs to get on the front-page.  Once on the front page, its onwards and upwards</li>
                </ul><p>Naturally, I turn to technology to tame coder social ills: <a href="post/15581427232.html" target="_blank">self-organising

    <h2>Deterministic Testing of Async Loops</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>A lot of in-production phone crashes I’ve debugged over the years have
                crashed in error-handling code.  The error handling code itself is never as well tested as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path" target="_blank">happy path</a>.</p>
                <p>Hackers like working on tools and hackers are often attracted to writing test frameworks.  I
                know I was.  So while working at UIQ (we made a smartphone OS) I wrote a simple exhaustive exception
                generator.</p>
                <p>By hooking into <em>malloc</em> and file/network/IPC calls, I made them
                deterministically fail.  By starting the app and making allocation 1 fail, then restarting it and making
                allocation 2 fail and so on it found buckets of defects in the start-up code for the Symbian app
                framework.  Most of this code only worked on the happy path.  Symbian engineers loved the tool and
                zapped masses of broken cleanup code in app framework startup and it took them about one day to do it :)</p>
                <p>However, Opera refused to run it on the browser they were making for us.  Their excuse was that
                the browser was using Symbian’s ActiveObject asynchronous worker task framework; like all
                event-loops that relies on external events like files opening or IO this makes the run of the program
                quickly non-deterministic.</p>

    <h2>Same Game, Same Sucker</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>I had <a href="post/15882406012.html" target="_blank">previously
                said</a>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>There is a new <a alt="dead link: http://infinitesearchspace.dyndns.org/samegame" href="/#404" target="_blank">SameGame
                </a>contest over at Infinite Search Space.  But I’m not tempted.  Yet.  Risk is, as I think more
                about it, I’ll think of some little thing and then I’ll try it out and then its a slippery slope…</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Admittedly <a href="post/16322614828.html" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> got my coding need sated, and so I became easy prey for thinking
                problems.</p>
                <p>That’s how it was that I was so easily suckered by <a alt="dead link: http://www.redcode.nl/" href="/#404" target="_blank">Roy</a> when he started asking me about how to
                quickly compute SameGame board moves…</p>
                <p>What started out as an outlining of how it might be fast turned into a brute solver in C++
                (well, C with encapsulation; my C++ tends not to be so STLised so sue me).  See, its hard to express
                things in Java (Roy’s choice language) when it gets to optimising implementation instead of
                algorithm.</p>
                <p>My C++ solver could do 5 million boards per second on one core of my hardly-new Core2 laptop. 
                My general prediction is that a fancy i7 gets about 1.5x better single-threaded performance.</p>
                <p>Brute force is a bit moot in any contest on a website called (only slightly inaccurately) <em>infinite
                search space</em>.</p>
                <p>Simple culling when the free balls can no longer beat the best score so far trimmed that down
                towards 2M/s; an expensive check but massively reducing the (still unbruteably massive) search space.</p>
                <p>I added a roulette to randomise the visit but weighted towards smaller groups first.  Down to
                1M/s; 0.8M/s on some of the bigger board sizes (where the cost of tracking more groups slows you down
                slightly).</p>
                <p>A general trick here is to generate random bits in say 32- or 64-bit quantities using any
                standard fast algorithm, but then consuming this with just the strictly necessary number of bits at a
                time.  If you are taking a normal 32- or 64-bit random number and throwing all but one bit away to make
                a choice, that’s going to <em>really</em> slow you down.</p>
                <p>I often ask questions I think I know the answer to on StackOverflow, because often you get
                interesting mind-expanding angles and corrections (but sadly <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8703223/re-using-random-number-in-reservoir-sampling" target="_blank">not always</a>).  So I asked something <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9116361/how-to-efficiently-nearly-sort-a-list" target="_blank">SameGame-related</a>
                and got a JSort lead that is well worth following up :)  (Only of course with a roulette you don’t
                actually need to sort them.)</p>
                <p>I think with effort you could get performance back up towards 2M/s but with rather less
                readability or hackability.</p>
                <p>Thing is, I’m scared to sink more free time into this.  But I can’t stop
                thinking about it just when I think I’m successfully focusing on something more mundane. 
                Arrrgggghhhh Roy its all your fault :)</p>
