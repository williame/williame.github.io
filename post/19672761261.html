<post-body><p>A long time ago I tried to make Symbian’s UIQ phone UI competitive with
                Apple’s iPhone UI.  Its true!  I was going to use Flash…</p>

                <li>take on Apple!</li>
                </ol><p><!-- more -->Back to the beginning; after the UIQ phone UI shipped on the Sony
                Ericsson P800 and P900 it was time for a rewrite.  UIQ had been written for pen-based smartphones but
                the general pattern was for smartphones to push down into keypad-based phones.<br/><br/>The
                Symbian UI for keypad-based phones was called Series 60 and was entirely owned and controlled by Nokia. 
                Clearly the other Symbian licensees needed an answerable keypad UI of their own!<br/><br/>Our
                customers at Sony Ericsson’s smartphone division were skeptical.  The division was heavily
                engineer-led and they just wanted to keep punching out incremental improvements of the P-series phones. 
                (I could agree with them on that!  But sadly that wasn’t the bigger picture.)<br/><br/>Despite
                this, UIQ set off to build a rewritten framework that supported multiple form-factors dynamically.  This
                was called UIQ 3 and it was underway when I joined UIQ as an engineer in the ‘framework’
                team.<br/><br/>The framework team were the 10 or so programmers who made the entire UI
                framework; all the other teams at UIQ were making apps on top of it like messaging UI or telephony UI or
                contacts UI and such.  Some teams wrote whole chunks of their own custom UI frameworks with as mixed
                success as the real framework team.<br/><br/>Around this time Motorola, who had flirted with
                UIQ 2 on their first 3G phones (with all the grace and weight of a brick), came back and liked what they
                heard.  They were on board for UIQ 3.<br/><br/>Again the first UIQ 3 devices were Sony
                Ericsson’s P1 and M1.  These were hybrid pen-based touch-screen phones with keypads.  It was
                as though there was some design conflict within Sony Ericsson where the smartphone engineers kept their
                touch UI whilst the management insisted that a keyboard was tacked on the bottom.  With their qwerty
                keypads and portrait form-factor they were actually great phones for text messaging.<br/><br/>Remember
                that all touch screens were still resistive at this point; you could manipulate the screen with sharp
                finger jabs only if you had dainty fingers and pointy nails.<br/><br/>At this time we looked
                around at all the trade shows and at competing phones and we knew we already looked obsolete :(<br/><br/>By
                now I had moved from being the architect for the graphics team (the framework team had grown and been
                split into 'graphics’ and 'platform’ (everything else) teams) to being Product
                Manager for Graphics, Multimedia and Performance.  A grand title but really it was because I realised
                that the only way to make UIQ into the monster I wanted it to be was to write the spec myself!  By
                moving into product management I’d be able to write the requirements that, as a developer in
                the graphics team, I’d have wanted to implement.<br/><br/>Naturally, in hindsight,
                I see that this political self-interest was readily misinterpreted and mistrusted by the new wave of
                programmers flooding into the growing graphics and platform teams.  We’ll get back to this
                bitter pill later.<br/><br/>The prospect of the Apple iPhone was just a rumour but there
                were already plenty of fancier, prettier phones on the market.  The fanciest phones were on the Japanese
                market.  It wasn’t widely known - it was a secret, even - that many of those phones ran Adobe
                Flash!<br/><br/>Sony Ericsson’s feature phone division were flirting with Flash as
                an app language.  Adobe themselves were trying to push Flash as the app runtime for all phones and
                trying to use the operators to do so.  Motorola was super-keen we adopt Flash too.<br/><br/>So
                UIQ needed saving and all outside pressure and acceptance was for Flash.  Of course, the engineers were
                afraid of Flash.  They wanted SVG because it was a vendor-neutral open technology.<br/><br/>But
                I knew it had to be Flash.  Have you ever tried to author an SVG file?  It was not straightforward! 
                Flash was the tool that our customer’s UI and interaction designers actually used in their
                mockups and prototypes; anything else would be an impedance mismatch.<br/><br/>Imagine a
                future where the designers could simply save their work and they’d have the UI?  I did :)<br/><br/>Its
                necessary to take a detour through the graphics stack on a Symbian phone at this point:<br/><br/>Symbian
                was a micro-kernel and the Window Server was its own process.  Each application was a client of the
                Window Server and used IPC to create windows and draw to them.  The drawing was all serialised in
                buffers and sent to the Window Server.<br/><br/>The first windowing system was very much
                like the Microsoft Windows one; windows were opaque and rectangular (possibly with a non-rectangular
                clipping region; this means that a window is actually a whole constellation of small rectangles in
                formation).<br/><br/>When a window was exposed, the window server sent a message to each
                newly visible rectangle of window and asked it to send back the draw commands.  These commands were then
                clipped and drawn by the window server to the screen.  This is reactive drawing.<br/><br/>When
                I was starting on Flash UIs the Window Server was somewhat fancier.  It now supported semi-transparent
                windows and, most importantly, it recorded all drawn commands to buffers so it could replay the draw
                commands without waking the client up.  Symbian had retained-mode drawing and it worked really well.<br/><br/>I
                had myself already added a plugin system to the Window Server so clients could draw draw-ops that would
                trigger plug-ins to draw rather than being restricted to drawing standard primitives like bitmaps and
                rectangles and such.  This was the Content Rendering Plug-in (CRP) system and is worth a whole blog post
                of its own.  UIQ was no longer hostage of Symbian’s release planning for adding graphical
                goodness.<br/><br/>Allowing us (not third parties) to write custom code in the Window Server
                had already allowed us to make animations animate inside the window server rather than going backwards
                and forwards over IPC to the client.  This allowed super-smooth animated SVG application icons and such
                and dramatically improved both graphics frame-rate and UI responsiveness.<br/><br/>We also
                used CRPs for transition engine plug-ins.  Sony Ericsson used TAT’s transition engine.  TAT -
                The Awesome Tribe - were a great little group of demo-scene hackers who had formed a company making
                music video effects.  But they quickly branched out into graphics programming and made a transition
                engine.  They were in Lund where Sony Ericsson’s feature-phones were made and were one of the
                constellation of companies clustered there hoping Sony Ericsson would license them.  TAT grew and moved
                to Malmö and went on to develop UI polish for the first Android phone.  (If you look intently at the
                clock dial on the G1 you’ll see it says its made in Malmö.)  TAT later <a alt="dead link: http://www.tat.se/blog/tat-to-join-a-larger-tribe/" href="/#404" target="_blank">got brought</a> by
                RIM; and if anyone saves RIM it’ll be them.<br/><br/>TAT is important because, by
                some massive colossal cock-up, Motorola failed to license them!  This left the Motorola’s UIQ
                phones without any fancy transition effects.  I set out to write a quick hack engine of our own.  So UIQ
                had a skunk-works transition engine that worked by intercepting all the drawing by a client and
                recording these draw commands to its own buffer and sending that buffer to a CRP in the window server
                were they were drawn animated sliding on or off or exploding or fading or such.<br/><br/>This
                is a fundamental thing; when a developer draws a rectangle or bitmap, he’s not actually
                drawing it.  He’s just issuing the command to draw it and that command gets parceled up and
                sent to a window server and it can be intercepted and chopped up and muddled with client-side or
                server-side.<br/><br/>Rewriting our apps using Flash is basically throwing away UIQ.  The
                application logic would also be thrown away.  And implementing all the bindings and application logic
                for Actionscript would take an army of coders that UIQ didn’t have.<br/><br/>Flash
                had other disadvantages; it was a monolithic memory hog.  At the time we had phones with 32MB of RAM and
                64MB or more was being discussed; we needed each app to take just a few MB and be closeable so only
                visible apps were actually running.  When our designers made Flash mock-ups they took 10 or 20MB!  It
                wasn’t as though you could just take a Flash UI and drop it on our phones.  It was also a
                notoriously slow renderer.  It didn’t do internationalisation nor IPC.<br/><br/>Again
                Sony Ericsson’s smartphone division, engineer-driven as ever, were skeptical.  However, the
                Sony Ericsson feature-phone division had solved many of these problems with their new  Cappuccino
                platform.  I wanted to align with the feature phone division and their whole scheme and ambition really
                impressed me; even though I couldn’t win over the smartphone engineers, I felt the feature
                phone engineers at Sony Ericsson were onto something and I adopted their wisdom enthusiastically.<br/><br/>My
                plan was simple: <strong>Artwork Based Layout (ABL)</strong>; we use Flash as a layout tool
                and nothing else.  We put a Flash renderer in a CRP (as we had SVG before) and used swf files as
                templates for laying out the controls and content as sent by the client.<br/><br/>So a UI
                would basically be providing a selection of widget content to be placed and drawn by a separate Flash
                template that some designer had written for that phone at that screen resolution.  Our apps would need
                very minimal changes and perhaps even none at all if they were truly using the UIQ framework.</p>
                <p>In Flash you can use scripts to control animation and interaction and not just for business
                logic.  We hadn’t allowed scripts into SVG for our animated icons and we were unwilling to
                allow scripts in for the UI.  We had two options open - to put the scripts in the window server, or put
                the scripts into a sandbox process and serialise interaction with them.  We were pretty familiar with
                the intricacies of the sandbox approach and so we decided to go that route and revisit the decision only
                if performance was nonviable.<br/><br/>I went out to the valley and sold this vision to
                Motorola.  They were super enthusiastic - the impact on their own development would be monumentally
                positive.  It was an exhilarating aside to see one of their architects - Bill Maggs, who had been CTO of
                Palm before - grasp the deep technical issues and implications.  You could, he appreciated, use SVG or
                even HTML for the layout!  But it was clear that Flash was the business-case winner.<br/><br/>As
                further validation a blog post by the legendary Zack, then at Trolltech, later described much <a href="https://zrusin.blogspot.se/2006/08/magic.html" target="_blank">the same idea</a>.  UIQ was
                no longer alone in imagining artwork-based layout as the way forward.<br/><br/>My
                predecessor as architect in platform was Mathias; he was massively more successful on his shift than I
                was on mine and he can largely be credited with the success of UIQ 2 and 3.  He moved to Symbian in
                London and became their UI framework architect.  A couple of platform colleagues followed him and had a
                great time in London.  We worked closely and got along really well but we had very different visions of
                the future; he wanted Symbian to <em>replace</em> UIQ (and Series 60) and providing the next
                generation UI.  He set out to make it.<br/><br/><em>UIQ set out to prototype ABL.</em></p>
                <p>Sadly, despite being able to prove to myself that each and every step was validated, my own
                engineering team and Symbian rebelled :(</p>
                <p>I’d borrowed Mathias back from Symbian for the push and his viewpoint that Symbian
                should be doing UI frameworks carried weight too.  The final presentation was torpedoed and scuppered. 
                Some parts of the demo were cool: you could draw in the Flash Studio and, every time you pressed save,
                the screen on a phone emulator updated!  But the engineers were unanimous - UIQ should write their own
                UI framework, or adopt Symbian’s “next-gen” UI; anything but adopt Flash.</p>
                <p>And they were really wary of putting plug-ins in the window server too.  Animation belonged
                client-side.  That was pretty hard for me to swallow, since I’d learned to put animation as
                close to the screen as possible for hard-won performance reasons.<br/><br/>And then <strong>the
                iPhone launched and it was gorgeous</strong>.  It was a rightful winner and UIQ hadn’t
                even started the race.<br/><br/>Footnote: After this, and via Operator pressure, I got my
                hands on the generic Flash renderer for phones.  It was notoriously slow.  I quickly skunk-works ported
                it with a colleague so it ran on Symbian; it took a week.  The renderer was not the desktop renderer; it
                was an SVG-like renderer that Adobe had brought in from some company and it was really quite tidy.  But
                it was nearly as slow as the desktop renderer; some quick poking and fixing and a bit of streamlining
                and it ran super fast.  I have never quite understood how Flash has always been slow; I believe Adobe
                simply don’t put engineers on the problem.  I met far more suits at Adobe than convincing
                engineers, sadly.</p>
