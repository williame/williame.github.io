    <p>Basic on my ZX81 graduating to assembler and Turbo Pascal during my teens.</p>
    <p>Developed phone OS software - engineer, architect, product manager - but got made irrelevant by the
        iPhone and redundant by Android.</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>My two girls - 3 and 5 - got a computer for Christmas!  Its just an old desktop
                running <a href="http://www.qimo4kids.com/" target="_blank">Qimo</a> but it is theirs and
                they’re thrilled.</p>
                <p>I haven’t shown them how to do anything; they have worked everything out for
                themselves.  Early on, though, I realised how fun and instructive it was to pay attention to what they
                had worked out and how; they were building little mental models of how computers work.</p>
                <p>One of their favourite programs is <a href="http://tuxpaint.org/" target="_blank">TuxPaint</a>. 
                It is a nice painting program for kids.  In it there is a button that creates a new picture.  As it does
                so, it asks you if you want to save your current picture.  The girls had been clicking the ‘yes’
                button (not that they can read the button text at all; just from trial and error they know the green
                button takes them forwards).</p>
                <p><img height="120" src="http://tuxpaint.org/screenshots/starter-coloringbook-t.png" width="160"/><img height="120" src="http://tuxpaint.org/screenshots/dialog_saveover-t.png" width="160"/><img height="120" src="http://tuxpaint.org/screenshots/dialog_open-t.png" width="160"/></p>
                <p>The other day they discovered a button that lets them load a saved picture; so, clicking on it,
                they saw an archive of every picture they had ever done!</p>
                <p>I didn’t witness this, but I’d have loved to see their faces.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I did look in on them a while later.  And they were systematically opening each saved
                picture… <em>and erasing it</em>.   I asked them why…</p>
                <p><em><strong>So they could reuse the paper</strong></em>, they said.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->Qimo is a nice Linux distribution.  I had imagined that Linux would be full
                of 'edutainment’ games and puzzles.  To my surprise, most of the apps though are, well, <em>underwhelming</em>. 
                They seem dated and with inconsistent UI paradigms.  I’ve seen silly spelling mistakes and
                even, in I think it is <a href="http://childsplay.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">ChildsPlay</a>,
                a game of guessing the name of the animal where the names are sometimes wrong!</p>
                <p>Of course the easy chorus is that its all open-source so I should fix this myself!  Hmm.  Start
                from scratch, more like :(</p>
                <p>I would love to be wrong; if you know a great fresh edutainment app or distribution (of course
                looks aren’t everything; content is everything, looks are very definitely secondary.  But
                still, no glaring wrongs) then please do say.</p>
                <p><img align="right" height="300" src="http://ri-li.sourceforge.net/images/screenshot3.jpg" width="400"/>One game that really stands out though is the excellent <a href="http://ri-li.sourceforge.net/index.html" target="_blank">Ri-Li</a> (pictured).</p>
                <p>Surprisingly my girls haven’t really fastened on it in the same way I have.  I think
                its great with catchy music and captivating, pretty graphics.  It strikes me as a hit on the iPad (its
                GPL so that’ll never happen).</p>
                <p>The app that they like best and learn most from is a Swedish game called <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fem_myror_%C3%A4r_fler_%C3%A4n_fyra_elefanter" target="_blank">“Fem
                myror är fler än fyra elephanter”</a> (five ants are more than four elephants).  It is a
                Shockwave game and I’m running it via Wine.  It needs to run off the CD and it simply doesn’t
                have a quick way to exit (the exit sequence is with a credits roll just like the TV series and there
                seems no way to hurry it up).  Apart from the difficulty actually starting it or stopping it, the girls
                love it and get involved with it in a way they simply don’t with the other games.  I wonder
                the extent to which it has been designed pedagogically?  (And the extent to which the other games I’ve
                found on Qimo have not?)</p>
                <p>I had never really thought much about just how inconsistent the interface of various apps is
                until I tried to plan how to explain to the girls how to close an app.  Some apps are full-screen and
                they have red crosses in the bottom-right to close them.  Others have 'back arrow’ buttons;
                others need ctrl-W whilst for others ctrl-F4 works.  The tick and cross for yes and no is fairly widely
                used in childrens programs if not in business apps, but then there are those that use a cross to mark
                your selection in multiple choice and I’ve heard the girls arguing about what that means.</p>
                <p>I’m really not fond of <a href="post/15415341205.html" target="_blank">Ubuntu’s
                Unity</a> but I do think that the modal full-screen interface would have made exploring much
                simpler for the girls.  They regularly open multiple versions of the same app and get lost when they are
                not maximised. This happens for two main reasons:</p>
                <ol><li>many of the patience-style games have the new game option under a menu; when the
                girls have finished the game, there is no feedback, nothing.  They know that clicking on the icon in the
                picker bar will launch a new game, so they launch a new instance of the app so they can play again</li>
                <li>a click slightly outside the window will bring another game window to the foreground; they
                frown, and click on the game icon in the picker bar to start on the game they want to play again</li>
                </ol><p>Their desktop is filled with shortcuts they didn’t mean to make and they
                have really messed things up twice by exploring the 'settings’ menu.  I really wish that the
                whole thing was much more locked down - I’d be fine teaching them how to type in a simple
                password to get to the settings but anything to stop inadvertent accidents.  Its really teaching them to
                not dare click anything when the screen goes blank.</p>
