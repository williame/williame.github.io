<post-body><p><span>Back in 2004 I published this on an OS hobby site.  I never heard of any
                hobbyists actually doing anything I suggested conceptually.</span><br/><br/>This
                article offers feature suggestions to budding OS developers looking for that neat edge. This osnews
                mini-series is a series to give people developing hobby operating systems - for fun - ideas that take
                their OS from a kernel to a ‘system’.</p>
                <p>In previous articles we have described using URIs [1] for file paths and the idea that streams
                of various types can be transparently converted between by the operating system [2]. This article
                describes how these might be unified into a single, consistent user interface.</p>

                <img alt="Opening Streams" border="0" height="307" src="https://sites.google.com/site/williamedwardscoder/_/rsrc/1279396222293/streams.jpg?height=307&amp;width=495" width="495"/><p>UNIX has the design principle that 'everything is a file’ [3]. A file
                is, more properly, a stream. I have introduced, in the previous article, the idea that a stream, if we
                know its type, might be presented transparently to a program as another, compatible type. This means
                that conceptually a file is in fact many streams, with each stream marked by type [4].</p>
                <p>Streams don’t just refer to physical files on your computer or remote computers.
                Streams can be generated by other things such as applications and device drivers. In UNIX, named pipes
                and UNIX-domain sockets provide this kind of facility [5].</p>
                <p>Many UNIX programs are an excellent example of applications that provide streams
                programmatically. The 'sort’ command takes one stream as input and outputs to another, as does
                the 'grep’ command. In fact, all command line programs do this. As our hobby operating system
                is marking streams by type, you could expect all these command line applications to be reading and
                writing text/plain streams. If you want to 'grep’ on a rich document, for example, the
                operating system would be quite capable of converting that to text/plain - if the virtual file system
                has the right plug-in - and 'grep’ need not know [6].</p>
                <p>We’ll make the jump that your hobby OS includes a GUI of sorts! How might
                applications provide streams for the user to interact with?</p>
                <p>GUI widgets (windows, even individual controls such as text boxes) might report to the system
                that they provide/consume streams of certain mime-types. This would allow the window manager to provide
                drag-n-drop stream connections and work as a versatile clip-board. This is not so strange - this is
                pretty much what the windows clipboard is doing anyway!</p>
                <p>So think of 'open’ and 'save’ as reading and writing streams, rather than
                files (a slightly thin distinction to make, I know). Applications conventionally use standard system
                dialogs for allowing the user to select files to open and names of files to save-as. This allows the
                hobby operating system author to unify application streams, remote streams and file streams and present
                them to the user in a sensible manner.</p>
                <p>You’ll see from my dialog mockup that I allow the user to select from a recent
                streams history, from a location (much like a conventional file-open dialog) and by type. This later
                category is something akin to a search. Popular consensus in the human-computer-interaction camp at the
                moment seems to think that users don’t really remember where they put files or what they are
                called. Modern operating systems such as BeOS, Windows and the like are moving in the direction of
                letting the user search for files instead. This is the whole big idea behind the 'file system is a
                database’ hype at the moment!</p>
                <p>So the user doesn’t care where the stream comes from, they care only that they find
                their stream. The 'by type’ presents all files of the appropriate type, regardless of
                location. In the example dialog an application-provided stream is shown highlighted, mixed in with
                streams provided by conventional files from the user’s home directory.</p>
                <p>A 'by type’ query that is constantly updating live is termed an 'active query’
                and is one of the many big features in BeOS. The idea is that, while you have a search window open,
                files that are added, modified or removed that fit the terms of the query are automatically updated [7].</p>
                <p>The Save-As dialog might also present application streams as valid destinations. A user might
                'save’ a bitmap to their presentation software which is running at the moment, and that
                presentation software might insert that received image file into the actively-being-edited application.</p>
                <p>Opening a stream is assisted by search agents. The idea is that various mime-types might
                register search agents that take words, phrases or even complex query expressions and filter a list
                based upon user-entered criteria. You might want to only documents that contain a reference to a certain
                activity, for example. Various search agents might use meta-data, a contextual search or an index to
                find matches; it depends upon the mime-type and the agent’s needs.</p>
                <p>It could be taken further and integrate search agents that represent remote locations e.g.
                coalescing a Google search into a local files search.</p>
