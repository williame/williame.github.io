                <p>Its the game we wanted to play, so we made it!  We are super pleased and proud of it.  We
                didn’t settle on what we would make until the theme was announced; I had hoped we’d fly around a fractal
                landscape and put a lot of preparation time into learning ray-tracing.  In the end I think we
                shoe-horned the theme Evolution into it acceptably and got the very best game we’ve made to boot.<br/><br/>How
                would I sum up Cage Flight as a creator?  Fun and then tears.  Sorry for the hurt and drama in this
                post:<br/><br/><!-- more --><img src="media/old/30509144101_2.jpg"/></p>
                <p>Making a true 3D game the first time is hard.  Making a multi-player game the first time is
                hard.  Making that multi-player game real-time is hard.  And making a true 3D on-line multi-player game
                that works in your web-browser - now that is hard!  It has all kinds of challenges and components that
                we had never tackled before and had not prepared for.<br/><br/><strong>Browser games
                are the future!</strong><br/><br/>The real down-side to most Ludum Dare entries is
                that downloading them.  Do we really want to be running all these Windows exes?  And Unity web-client
                doesn’t run on Linux.<br/><br/>HTML5&amp;co has really brought new potential to browser
                games.  You have webGL, you have a new proper audio API and you have websockets.  A year ago I don’t
                think you could make a multi-player on-line 3D game in the browser.   A half-year ago you might have to
                use Chrome’s excellent Native Client.  And now you can just use the browser!  We’ve had very few people
                saying that they are using Internet Explorer and have no webGL ;)<br/><br/><strong>Quaternion
                hell</strong><br/><br/>Surprisingly, there isn’t any nice tutorial or anything about
                how to do 3D flight in a game; they tend to use gluLookAt or glRotatef for rotation and such and they’re
                all just doing it wrong!  I’ll have to make a little cheat-sheet for anyone Googling during the next LD.<br/><br/>Working
                with web/open/GL and meshes was no challenge, since the team draws from hobby RTS hackers.  It was just
                1st/3rd-person camera control that I had never tackled before.  When moving the camera over an RTS board
                you tend to have a fixed angle-to-the-horizon and movement is actually 2D.  But move to true 3D and the
                camera has a position and a rotation.  The rotation has to be represented by a Quaternion which is just
                4 floats; use classic roll, pitch and yaw (called the Euler angles) and you’ll end up with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock" target="_blank">gimbal lock</a>!  You have to
                be able to determine which direction is forward and which direction is up, and that’s encoded in the
                quaternion.<br/><br/>I lost about 10 hours debugging my which-way-is-forward code for the
                players.  My initial code was simple and obvious - multiply the inverse of the quaternion by a forward
                vector scaled by speed.  It would work at first but if you spun around more than 180 degrees, it started
                to fly backwards!  And after 10 hours of debugging, I got it working with basically the same code as I’d
                started with.  My problems seem to have stemmed from my library - pyeuclid - not doing what I wanted it
                to do regards quaternion*vector3 multiplication; moving the forward vector into a 0-rotation quaternion
                and it all worked.  I think my original vector3 code would work in a normal math library, so I think I
                lost the time more to a bug in the library than me doing it wrong.  But the fact was, I know so little
                geometry - or math in general - that I did not know how to recognise or diagnose where I was going
                wrong.  Hence 10 frustrating hours.<br/><br/>While fighting the quaternions I couldn’t
                really focus on the actual drawing of the camera.  Again, a lot of the Googleable material is
                out-of-date and uses glRotatef matrices.  In the end it was timely intervention by Philip’ (the <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/0-ad/news/pathfinding-update-24-january-2012" target="_blank">excellent</a>
                <a href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/0ad/" target="_blank">0ad dev</a>) who very quickly
                sorted out my camera code while I was going in circles with the server’s quaternion code.  I fear we’d
                have been much further schedule behind without his help.<br/><br/><strong>Multi-player
                via websockets</strong><br/><br/>The multi-player aspect worked really well (we
                thought).  Its super-simple to set up a websocket server (I used Python’s Tornado) and talk to clients. 
                The very good news is that the websockets can connect to a different server than the pages are served,
                which has always been a problem with classic AJAX.<br/><br/>So we have a websocket server,
                and we have all the players sending their key ups and downs to the server.  The server stores these in a
                little table and, N times a second, sees what keys the players are holding down and applies the correct
                rotations and movement to each player.  If the space bar is being held down, it might generate shots. 
                It then serialises the position and rotation of all players and shots and sends it to each player.  N
                times a second each player is receiving the position and rotation of each player and shot.  It then
                draws it.<br/><br/>So, in this design, the apparent frame-rate is actually lock-step with
                server.<br/><br/>Because websockets can be opened against non-origin servers, we were able
                to host the game code and artwork on github and only do the actual game-play bandwidth on my hobby VPS. 
                This is a good model you can copy.  Remember, though, that github-pages has cache-always headers so
                people have to clear their browser cache to get new versions of the game.  And in Chrome/Safari there
                doesn’t seem to be a reliable way to do location.reload(true) :(<br/><br/>We set the
                frame-rate to 8 fps and had lots of fun weaving around shooting each other!  The <a href="http://www.megaglest.com/" target="_blank">Glest</a> community stood up and fought!  It
                was play-testing and discussing if up pitches up or down and if the ships moved fast enough or fired
                enough or the hit spheres were too small and so on.  We had testers from North America and they even
                <a href="post/30340192066.html" target="_blank">made
                videos</a>, attesting to the playable frame-rate they achieved:</p>
                <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yGSGiY9sISs" width="420"> </iframe></p>
                <p>Now if you’ve read much in the way of proper game how-tos (I fuzzily remember reading about the
                Doom/Quake approach and a really great article about the Age of Empires II RTS) you’ll recall that
                that’s not how you do it!  Proper games have the some client-side interpolation between receiving
                updates from the sever.  And its hard to miss all the talk about <em>slerp</em>ing when you
                google quaternions.<br/><br/>The flaw was that our initial game-play went so well that we
                did not identify 8 fps as a problem.  In reality we had three problems:</p>
                <ol><li>players are unhappy with 8 fps.  Their expectations were much higher.  They think 8
                fps is crap and buggy and call the game unplayable</li>
                <li>players don’t always get as good Internet connections to my cheap hobby VPS in Sweden as I
                do.  Even I can get poor connections occasionally.  The server times out clients who haven’t sent
                anything for 3 seconds and clients themselves time out if they haven’t received anything from the server
                in 2 seconds and the sad truth is that this happens all the time :(</li>
                <li>websockets are TCP-based and TCP has never been a popular protocol for anything with any
                semblance of low-latency game-playing requirements.  But you can’t just chuck UDP into browser games. 
                What we won in simplicity</li>
                </ol><p>I could have told you all this.  I used to write streaming video servers and clients
                ffs.  But, somehow in my recent focus on servers connected to each other over 100G I forgot it all.  As
                I said, the moment we played our game at 8 fps all thought of client-side prediction went out of my
                mind.  I thought we had a winning game.<br/><br/>And lets face it - client-side prediction
                is not trivial.  There’s a lot of corner cases and it can smooth out tweens between server frames but it
                can’t really invent whole new frames when it can’t reach the server for a whole half-second.  Would it
                have made the game playable?<br/><br/><strong>“Exasperated wifes and
                children to unneglect”</strong><br/><br/>Jam entries have three days but we
                have jobs to go to on Monday, exasperated wifes and children to unneglect.  So we were working a weekend
                schedule.  Being in Europe, we didn’t even have quite the same easy weekend as you North American kids. 
                The theme was announced at 2am and we lost a few hours before we got up, breakfasted, kissed the kids
                goodbye and locked ourselves in our studies.<br/><br/>We skimmed on laser rendering and
                didn’t actually put in a particle effects engine that I had imagined.  We’d played the game and thought
                it was perfectly fun without them.<br/><br/>Maybe with more time we could have slipped in
                slerping in the client.  We seem to have the tools necessary, now we’ve wrestled with and nailed
                quaternions.  But its a half-fix, and doesn’t address the fundamental, bursty-nature of TCP.<br/><br/><strong>Sound</strong><br/><br/>We
                did slip in some sound effect for the laser (yeah, I know lasers are silent in real life!) and use cool
                open-source text-to-speech software to make computer-like voices (as we were un-musical and lacked
                decent microphones).  I imagined 3D sound for the other players, but again that fell out of our time
                budget.<br/><br/>Early attempts using HTML’s &lt;audio&gt; element to play sounds
                was a disaster.  Just calling play can cause a webGL freeze of half a second or so.  It was unplayable.<br/><br/>There
                is a very new Audio API (I believe a lot of credit goes to pushers at Microsoft for that; thanks!) and
                Chrome supports it, as does the upcoming version of Firefox.  We did get crackily audio for the intro
                speech on some Chrome browsers on Linux caused, we think, by network activity.  But overall it worked
                really well and had no impact on FPS.<br/><br/><strong>Launch!</strong><br/><br/>The
                game launched on Sunday.  Its a multi-player game so we went over to the Ludum Dare IRC chat-room and
                extolled people to play.  And we had some pretty epic games with 10 or 20 fighters all zooming around
                the cage and shooting each other.  It was such a high to be playing something you’ve made and seeing
                total strangers also playing it!<br/><br/>The complaints about the FPS were fairly
                understanding in the IRC chat-room.  The calibre of people who hang out there is high and these people,
                perhaps, understood the challenges to making an on-line multi-player game with any semblance of
                real-time combat.  Or perhaps they complain less to the face.  But in the LD entry page comments there
                were rather fewer well-dones and back-pats.<br/><br/>I sat in the cage Monday and Tuesday
                evening, to ensure people had someone to play with.  And you’d see players popping into existence in the
                cage, and waggle around a bit as they discover the controls, then move forward a bit, then fire, then
                … vanish.    The vanishing can be split into two classes; those who had done nothing for a
                second or so so might have timed out on the client.  And those who had been making some intricate
                maneuver and its hard to imagine they got a time-out.  Either which way, the game tries to restart and
                these players didn’t.<br/><br/>The game just isn’t as gripping as we found it.<br/><br/>We
                could have polished the game much more; added more arcade-style stuff like NPCs to fight, bonuses to
                collect, hoops to fly though for extra points, power ups etc.  But that wasn’t the game we wanted to
                build; we wanted distilled combat.<br/><br/><strong>Innovative?</strong><br/><br/>Will
                we be back for the next LD?  You bet!  We might stop trying to be different, though.  Our
                first-of-its-kind <a href="post/21677376271.html" target="_blank">spatial-text-adventure-with-beautiful-graphics</a>
                fell flat on its face and so too has our attempt at doing real-time multi-player.  We’ll end up doing a
                platform game using tiles in an effort to win compliments, I’m sure ;)</p>
