                <p>An interactive, clickable map of the worlds religions is available on-line at <a href="https://williame.github.com/map_of_worlds_religions/" target="_blank">http://williame.github.com/map_of_worlds_religions/</a></p>
                <p>Here’s a time-lapse of it running, with the narrative (which you can mute in the
                interactive version) ↓</p>
                <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mEIxdquRnJc" width="560"> </iframe></p>
                <p>The real making of the map was excellent research by <a href="post/30793134312.html" target="_blank">the usual suspect</a>.  After his <a href="post/19946053957.html" target="_blank">Enigma</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cmnMlvfTDoM" target="_blank">
                spreadsheet</a>, and other side projects, he recently took it into his head to make a world
                religion time-line spreadsheet.  And my blog post about how we moved from a spreadsheet to a web-page
                can’t really hide that the hard work wasn’t technical, it was research.  But here’s
                a technical article:</p>
                <p>My friend’s an Excel wizard, but he chose to use <strike>Sun</strike>/<strike>Open</strike>/LibreOffice
                Calc.  Oh boy what a mistake!</p>
                <p>Of course he roped me in to critique and fix.</p>
                <p><em><strong>LibreOffice Calc sucks!</strong></em></p>
                <p>His first version had a macro that went through the cells on the map and looked up their
                religion of that year on the main data set and then looked that religion up to determine the colour.</p>
                <pre><code>for x in width:<br/>     for y in height:<br/>         religion =
                cell(x+year,y,data_sheet)<br/>         colour = default_colour<br/>         for i = 0; i
                &lt; numReligions; i++:<br/>             if cell(0,i,lookup_sheet).text == religion:<br/>
                                colour = cell(0,i,lookup_sheet).text.background_colour<br/>                 break<br/>
                        cell(x,y,map_sheet).background_colour = colour</code></pre>
                <p>The map is 70x80 (so 5,600 cells), and the most popular religions are at the top of the lookup
                list.</p>
                <p>And yet <em>that</em> took 20 to 30+ seconds to run on modern laptops.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->This is just wrong on so many levels.  The most inefficient code should do
                such a calculation in less than a second.  Excel 5 in Windows 3.1 on a 486 would have run rings around
                LibreOffice on this!</p>
                <p>Being the wizard in Excel, my friend was flabbergasted by this shockingly poor performance by
                LibreOffice here.  This sloppy, inefficient code is not at all a problem in VBA.</p>
                <p>He halved the time by skipping the 50% of cells that were Sea.  And it was still taking forever
                to change years.</p>
                <p>So <em>I</em> dived in to speed it up… and surfaced red faced and making
                excuses :(</p>
                <p>LibreOffice’s Basic editor is a hollow unloved backwater; absolutely nothing like the
                excellent VBA editor in Microsoft Office.</p>
                <p>It doesn’t have any associative arrays (the undocumented ones I found mentioned in
                various confused forums didn’t work for us), so I couldn’t move the religion to
                colour mapping into code.  I simply couldn’t find a quick way to write the for-loops better.</p>
                <p>The next step was to try and move the styling into formula instead using the <code>T()</code>
                and <code>STYLE()</code> functions and <code>VLOOKUP()</code>s etc.  This was
                much, much faster.  But it still took seconds.</p>
                <p>Everything in LibreOffice takes seconds.  Opening documents takes seconds, recalculating takes
                seconds, messages that its recalculating column widths takes seconds.</p>
                <p>I clicked around and wrote macros to do things like convert a colour to hex (the Basic even
                lacks a <code>hex()</code> function) and generally became familiar with LibreOffice Calc. 
                It feels like a dated and unresponsive Excel.</p>
                <p>The more I used LibreOffice, the stronger my dislike for the whole copy-by-committee,
                no-obvious-pride-nor-perfection feel for it all took over.  Pity those sacrificing their souls for
                something so unloved.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Who settled Madagascar?</strong></em></p>
                <p>But by now I was being charmed by the data-set.  Did you know that it was Indonesians going
                west that settled Madagascar, rather than Africans going east?  I had <em>no</em> idea. 
                What Christianity was once the official religion off Mongolia?  What’s the religion of
                Switzerland?  I had no idea about most of it, in fact.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Rendering on the Web</strong></em></p>
                <p>My mind raced; even a noddy Python spreadsheet would compute it all near-instantly.  Yes, I
                know all about how spreadsheets calculate.  No, LibreOffice is not solving some massively big problem. 
                No, there are no excuses for being so painfully slow compared to all the other spreadsheets.  You even
                find people recommending to edit LibreOffice spreadsheets in other office suites!</p>
                <p>Even Javascript would do it.  <em>Aha!</em>  What we needed in this day and age is
                a web page!</p>
                <p>It was easy to copy-n-paste the LibreOffice worksheets into a text editor, where they appeared
                as tab-separated-value files.  This is a super-easy text format to parse in Javascript.</p>
                <p>For drawing the map, I opted for <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/view/html-5-canvas-the-basics/" target="_blank">HTML5 canvas</a>
                2D <code>fillRect()</code> and so on, rather than my usual route in to webGL.  My thinking
                was, I didn’t want to over-optimise it in the first cut!</p>
                <p>And, of course, a normal HTML5 canvas can draw the whole map in the blink of an eye.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Narrative</strong></em></p>
                <p>My friend prefers to remain anonymous.  So we opted for text-to-speech like used for the intro
                to our <a href="https://williame.github.com/ludum_dare_24_evolution/" target="_blank">Cage Flight</a>
                <a href="post/30509144101.html" target="_blank">game</a>.</p>
                <p>A quick toying with <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/" target="_blank">festival</a>
                and <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">espeak</a> were really
                disappointing; they all sound like constipated daleks.  But it happens that Google has a text-to-speech
                (TTS) synthesizer in Google Translate in a non-public API.  If you feed it short snippets of text, you
                can get corresponding mp3 files which you can concatenate to make your total audio clip.  I borrowed a
                <a href="https://glowingpython.blogspot.se/2012/11/text-to-speech-with-correct-intonation.html" target="_blank">snippet</a> from the web and made a conversion <a href="https://github.com/williame/map_of_worlds_religions/blob/gh-pages/map_v4_audio.py" target="_blank">script</a>.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Compressing the Map in Javascript</em></strong></p>
                <p>The problem, though, was the data size.  The main map data was nearly 5MB and github-pages
                doesn’t do gzipping.  (As its static content, github could pre-compress everything, store it
                compressed, and decompress to serve to clients not supporting compression…)</p>
                <p>The data is a 5600 lines - one line for each of the 80x70 cells on the map.  And each line is a
                list of values, one per year on the timeline, saying what religion is in that cell in that year.  There
                are 91 years picked out on the time-line.</p>
                <p>I Googled around and tried out some LZ77 and other Javascript parsers.  And they were all
                terribly slow.</p>
                <p>I considered the <a alt="dead link: http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/05/compression-using-canvas-and-png.html" href="/#404" target="_blank">PNG
                approach</a> but, being interested in data compression, I decided that a super-simple home-made
                approach would be effective.</p>
                <p>So I set myself the task of making a map data decompressor in Javascript in one hour.</p>
                <p>I had some constraints.  I wanted it to be printable text, for one thing.  I wanted to keep the
                tab and new-line for splitting things up, and not for the actual map data.</p>
                <p>So I assigned each religion a single printable character.  I then made a string from them, for
                each year, for each cell.</p>
                <p>This was under half a megabyte, simply because one-character codes are massively shorter than
                the very redundant spelling out of each religion in the original tab-separated-value file.   80 x 70 x
                91 = 509,600 bytes.</p>
                <p>But I then run-length compressed this.  If three or more cells are the same religion in a row,
                I emit a special flag symbol and then printably-encode the number of repetitions in the run rather than
                emitting all the individual characters.</p>
                <p>Its a very obvious approach.  And the resulting file was around 160K.</p>
                <p>But this was still missing a lot of redundancy.  Most cells do not change from one year to the
                next, and their neighbouring cells do not change either.  So I replaced these non-changes with another,
                special religion code which means “same as last year”.  Technically, a form of delta
                encoding.  And now, when run through the run-length-encoder, the output is under 10K!</p>
                <p>My hour wasn’t up so I added a few features such as support for longer runs by
                emitting two character run-length codes.   I didn’t make further obvious optimisations by
                simply omitting Sea nor doing <a href="https://cbloomrants.blogspot.se/2012/09/09-04-12-lz4-optimal-parse.html" target="_blank">optimal
                parsing</a> - selecting between ‘same as last year’ and the religion code when
                it best helps compression etc.  I even left a few bytes on the table with my rather narrow run-length
                codes themselves.  Because I restrict myself to 7-bit printable characters (and don’t even use
                the full range of them), I’m leaving more than 1K of unused high-bits in there too.  In a
                one-hour project, you have to accept some imperfections if its functional.</p>
                <p>But it was really worth it.  The browser can download a 12KB (with religion names, colours and
                year index too) of data and then unpack it in the blink of an eye.  The whole waiting for data message
                is dismissed in a flash.</p>
                <p>How is that for ratio?  Well, lets do some rough comparisons:</p>
                <p>The original data file (without religion names) is <strong>4,803,202 bytes.</strong></p>
                <p>Gzipping gives 69,337 bytes.  1.443557859%.  Not bad!  Clearly this is an extremely redundant
                file.  If github-pages was supporting gzip, we’d never have had this problem to solve.<br/></p>
                <p>7zipping gives 31,648 bytes.  0.658893796%.  Better.</p>
                <p>ZPAQing gives 13,160 bytes.  0.273983896%.  Good!</p>
                <p>RLE delta, as we implemented in Javascript gives <strong>9,958 bytes</strong> for
                the map data.  0.207320033%.  As there are 5600 cells in the map, that’s encoding the full
                time-line of 91 years for each cell in less than 2 bytes.<br/></p>
                <p><em><strong>When you are sending a fifth of a percent of the original file, I’d
                call that brilliant :)</strong></em><br/></p>
                <p>Of course, giving the half-a-megabyte of single-character map-data to Gzip, or better yet with
                the delta encoding too, would doubtless beat my puny RLE encoder; after all, proper compressors use
                entropy coding and all the bits in a byte and everything else!<br/></p>
                <p>I did play with tweaks to the algorithm a bit the day after, such as using unused printable
                characters to encode very short runs, and increasing the range of symbols used.  And the output was
                under 8K.  It felt a shame to say that it took <em>two</em> hours, though, so I never
                submitted it :)</p>
                <p>My quickly tweaked and tidied up version gave 8,381 bytes.  0.174487768%.  But I’d
                slept on it.</p>
                <p><em><strong>UPDATE</strong></em>: After posting this, a couple of
                people took up the challenge to out-compress me!  <a alt="dead link: http://www.redcode.nl/" href="/#404" target="_blank">Roy</a>
                got furthest, and I hope he blogs about how!</p>
                <p>I made some quick alterations that help compression: its best to order the map data in column
                order from bottom-right to top-left and the years from oldest to newest.  It makes a noticeable
                difference in the compressibility of this data set.</p>
                <p>I then added a post-past compressor:</p>
                <pre>10 count occurrences of all characters and digraphs, and strings up to a certain length (e.g.
                10 characters)
                20 if all characters are unused, what is the cost of converting the least common character to be a
                digraph?
                30 and what is the gain of replacing all the common substrings with a digraph, or a character?
                40 perform the greediest replacement
                50 go to 10 until no further gains</pre>
                <p>And the outcome is: <span><strong>5,475</strong><strong> bytes</strong></span>
                (0.113986461%)</p>
                <p>(Roy’s compression, when post-processed with this simple find-replace compressor,
                actually slightly improved on this!  But that’s his blog post to make, and it never made it
                into the map itself ;) )<br/></p>
