<post-body><p>thats SCRUM and TDD and all the rest; it is all those new ways of managing
                development projects and being super-productive and modern and buzzword-compliant; all the sprints,
                scrums, playing cards crass <em>commercial</em> nonsense.</p>
                <p>The management pitch is that by getting programmers to follow some process rote you will get
                good, predictable results out.</p>
                <p>See, the thing is, the success of the coding-part of a project is dependent on the calibre of
                the engineers doing that coding and not the process they follow. </p>
                <p><!-- more -->The success of the non-coding part of a project is dependent on the calibre
                of your sales/management and how they interact with the customer.  If you are trying to prescribe some
                rigid process, however lean, in order to make that interaction effective, then you have a customer
                interface problem and process isn’t going to help it.<br/><br/>Process is,
                actually, just tax.  If you need to follow a prescribed process in order to be in any way an effective
                coder then you are mediocre at best and so is <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000024.html" target="_blank">your work</a>
                and your project.  If you are a good programmer, you know yourself how to communicate and create your
                ‘process’ as you go along, lean and tailored to the problem at hand and the
                political lay of the land.  A <em>prescribed process</em> versus an<em> organic
                process</em>.<br/><br/>Iterative development is what we used to do when <a alt="dead link: http://programming-motherfucker.com/" href="/#404" target="_blank">we got things done</a>, and we didn’t
                have some process we <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">had to follow</a>
                to do it.  Common Sense.  Get Things Done.   A long way from the sham that is the Agile <em>business</em>
                though.</p>
                <hr/><p><code><small>Dear William,<br/><br/>Tried reaching you many

                we are glad to offer you a Extended early bird price of <strong>EURO 1135</strong>.<br/><br/>
                Do let me know if you would like to block a seat for you as we have only 5 seats left. <br/><br/>
                Looking forward for your earlier confirmation.<br/><br/> Best Regards,<br/>XXXXXXXX<br/>
                Enterprise Architecture Services</small></code></p>
                <hr/><p>As I wade through the rest of my spam folder, it’s chock full of
                invitations to expensive courses to make me certified this or trained in that.  Selling the whole new
                agile way forward is big business.  Some are on-line but most are proper hotel things where, for some
                four digit number of dollars, I can bring home my own pack of playing cards and be qualified to use
                them!<br/><br/>Given that I am not a fan of prescribed process as the solution to our
                problems, you can infer my opinion of the general quality and effectiveness of those programmers who
                teach these courses ;)  Or maybe they are super cool coders who just play the game and laugh at their
                customers as they exploit a lucrative niche?<br/><br/>A fun anecdote is to consider the
                belief the TDD crowd entertained that, by creating tests for a problem you couldn’t solve, you
                could somehow evolve a code that passed the tests and therefore solved the problem!  The result was a
                predictable classic: compare <a alt="dead link: http://devgrind.com/2007/04/25/how-to-not-solve-a-sudoku/" href="/#404" target="_blank">TDD Suduko</a> to a simple solve-problem-first-then-code approach by a clever
                chap.<br/><br/>My mind races back to <a href="http://redcoder.sourceforge.net/?p=species" target="_blank">my experiments</a> with genetic programming and the evolution of very niche
                anti-code.  That’s a fun aside.<br/><br/>In this <a href="post/13266462536.html" target="_blank">fantastic talk</a> Rich Hickey - creator of Clojure and all-round smart chap -
                talks about complexity in general and observes that <strong>the only people who can run fast are
                those who run very short races</strong>.  Of course, <em>by firing the starting pistol every
                100 yards and calling it a new sprint</em>, Agile solves that problem!<br/><br/>When I
                was a student I interned and then contracted for British Telecom in a team at their labs called <a href="post/17282439831.html" target="_blank">FastTrack</a>.  As BT was so big, BT’s IT process was big, ungainly
                and predictably late.  So a skunk-works team for executing stop-gap projects to fit immediate fires grew
                into FastTrack.  And because we were responsive, we got asked to do bigger and bigger projects, and our
                solutions became more and more relied upon.  It’s a cycle.<br/><br/>The agile <em>sales</em>
                movement is a FastTrack with the fatal flaw that it is not about developer calibre.  It’s
                about <strong><em>grinding programmers and trying to average them out</em></strong>. 
                No-one should be surprised when you get mediocre, predictably late projects.<br/><br/>In
                time there will be a new movement which paints Agile as broken, inefficient and bad and we’ll
                get a new brand.  That’s the kind of iterative development I’m looking forward to; a
                new target for our collective disdain ;)</p>
                <p>(Disclosure: I have a few of these certificates myself; I think I did it for the <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/10/27/bofh_and_the_conference/" target="_blank">trinkets</a>)</p>
                <p>Update: <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.fr/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html" target="_blank">Steve Yegge</a> said it in 2006, and its still true.  And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3766788" target="_blank">this</a> is a nice comment
                on Hacker News.</p>
                <p><a href="https://pindancing.blogspot.com.au/2009/09/let-agile-fad-flow-by.html" target="_blank">This</a> from 2009 is brilliant too.  Of course we all recall the <a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/" target="_blank">Coders At Work</a> <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html" target="_blank">Duct Tape Programmer</a>

                saga but I hadn’t read Ravi’s excellent perspective on it.  Ravi’s points
                are very much the points <em>I</em> was trying to make in this article too.<br/><br/>(And
                to everyone who wants to argue about my lumping all these distinct, separately-certified systems
                together; well, you’ll come around to my world view and want your money back with time.)</p>
