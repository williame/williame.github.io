<post-body><p>Previously: <em><a href="post/42912076785.html" target="_blank">Why
                is Ruby bad security?</a></em></p>
                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Ruby libraries need to stop being too powerful.</li>
                <li>Programmers need to understand the libraries they are using.</li>
                </ul><hr/><p>So, lets recap on the recent Ruby on Rails security woes.  For some
                non-obvious reason, Ruby on Rails supported YAML form parameters.</p>
                <p>And it turned out that the Ruby YAML parser can … instantiate complex objects.</p>
                <p>Why can the Ruby YAML parser instantiate complex objects, and why did the YAML author <a href="https://github.com/tenderlove/psych/issues/119" target="_blank">not see</a> this as a
                problem?</p>
                <p>So we swatted that bug; we stopped Rails allowing YAML.</p>
                <p><em>Only it then turns out</em> that Rails also supported XML form parameters.</p>
                <p>Now there are lots of nasty attacks against XML parsers like recursive entities and external
                entities and ways of DOSing the server; but that’s no different from attacking the hash-table
                used to store form parameters, I guess.</p>
                <p>The nasty thing about the <em>Ruby</em> XML parser is that it can embed YAML.</p>
                <p>Why can the XML parser embed YAML?</p>
                <p>Lets swat that vulnerability too.  Lets make sure that Rails only supports HTML form
                parameters.  On, and JSON.</p>
                <p><em>Only it then turns out</em> that the Ruby JSON parser … yes, you’ve
                guessed it … the <em>Ruby</em> JSON parser can instantiate complex objects too.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->I mean, come on, Javascript <strong>Simple</strong> Object
                Notation?  Not in Ruby it ain’t.</p>
                <p>The idea that its a Rails-only problem really falls down at this point; that Rails supported
                YAML and XML forms is, well, obviously crazy.  That Rails supports JSON forms is obviously expectable. 
                Its really a bigger Ruby problem in how the engineering approach across the Ruby community differs from
                the more classic approaches seen even in similar-placed languages like Python.</p>
                <p>Lisp’s boast is that <em>Code is Data</em>.  Ruby accidentally and
                regrettably allowed Data to become Code.  Oops.</p>
                <p><strong>The principle of least power</strong></p>
                <p>There’s a good, old-fashioned engineering principle called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power" target="_blank">principle of least power</a>. 
                As I see it, its <em>not</em> just for data formats (like JSON, XML and YAML) but also a
                mindset for developing things.</p>
                <p>Don’t take a detour to facilitate future expansion.  Don’t build
                special-case logic into a general-purpose library.  Compose complex systems from simple libraries
                instead of large, opaque libraries bristling with special-case support.</p>
                <p>I’ve said its a Ruby psyche thing.  <a alt="dead link: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/18o4e4/your_xml_parser_will_destroy_everything_you_have/c8gkppx" href="/#404" target="_blank">Others</a> blame Rubyist inexperience:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p><a href="post/42912076785.html" target="_blank">[Will]</a> says that “The aim is to be so declarative, so high-level
                as to no longer see nor understand what is happening beneath and before.” What really happens
                is that most people that work with ruby are simply not educated enough to understand what is happening
                “beneath and before.” Ruby tries to go the extra step to make programming seem
                closer to a normal language. This means that more people will be able to become sufficiently proficient
                in it to think they actually understand what they are actually doing, and will proceed to try their hand
                at writing complex systems. Unfortunately without some very solid grounding in much lower level
                languages, and language design in general, that apparent proficiency is just an illusion.</p>
                <p>In other words I wouldn’t necessarily blame ruby for bad code, any more than I would
                blame potassium nitrate for facilitating gun crime. Both are powerful tools that are useful in the right
                situations, and extremely dangerous in others. People simply need to learn not to take this power for
                granted. This is particularly true in the rails ecosystem, which is based around using gem upon gem upon
                gem without really understanding what most of them do</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Perhaps it is inexperience?  You and I might never dream of building in ways to escape from
                formats like XML to enable the embedding of YAML or that the JSON library should be able to
                serialise/deserialise complex objects by default and we’d say that was because we were <em>experienced</em>.</p>
                <p>But we will agree the whole Rubyist lets-bang-gems-you-couldn’t-write-together
                mindset has to go.  Programmers should know what the libraries they use do.  And those libraries should
                do what you expect them to do <em>and</em> <em>nothing more</em>.  There’s
                a whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" target="_blank">principle
                of least surprise</a> in library functionality.</p>
                <p>And always pay double-attention to deserialising data into code; never build that into the
                deserialisation library, always build that into a library that sits on top of the deserialisation
                library.</p>
                <p>I think the whole XML-embedded YAML - and JSON - vulnerability is under-explored.  These are
                data interchange formats and supporting arbitrary object instantiating in them is mind-bendingly wrong. 
                There must be a whole host of applications that process externally-received XML and JSON and, just like
                the rubygems YAML exploit, some Ruby app somewhere is deserialising XML or JSON that’s been
                stored in a database right now and … bang!</p>
