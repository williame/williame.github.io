    <p>Basic on my ZX81 graduating to assembler and Turbo Pascal during my teens.</p>

<post-body><p>In my essay <a href="post/16516763725.html" target="_blank">How I got massively faster DB with async batching</a> I described how to make a
                <em>write</em>-heavy database web-app go fast.  In this essay I will describe a technique I
                touched on which makes <em><strong>read-heavy</strong></em> database web-apps go
                fast!</p>
                <p>Most normal corporate database web apps are either blazingly fast or blazingly slow at the five
                week mark; either nobody is using them hence they are blazingly fast, or everyone is using them hence
                they are blazingly slow.</p>
                <p>This is because the straightforward way to connect a database to a web app is naive.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->A very large majority of databases are read-heavy and small.  Easily small
                enough to be stored in application memory.  How many rows in your product database?  10K perhaps?  How
                many users in the corporate directory?  How many pages in the knowledge base?  If the answer is less
                than a few million, and if the updates are less than a few hundred a second (or are only in big bulk
                batched update periods, as is common with product databases), then this approach will work for you:</p>
                <p>Simply store your database in RAM on your web server!</p>
                <p>Its so obvious, you knew I was going to say it.  So why doesn’t everybody do it?  (I’ll
                talk about distribution below:)</p>
                <p>You obviously want to keep an authoritative copy of the database on some reliable media, and a
                proper database server is ideal for this.  But you want reads and queries to be against a local copy
                rather than each being sent to the server to be answered.  This even allows you to maintain views of the
                data in RAM and invalidate or recalculate them as needed.</p>
                <p>Sadly I am unaware of any good frameworks for this (although with some pain and lots of gotchas
                <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/" target="_blank">sqlalchemy</a> does it somewhat, if not
                transparently).  It should be enough to say ‘store the entire contents of this table in RAM’
                and the ORM goes away and does that.</p>
                <p>I have made custom frameworks that do this.  My own frameworks have been asynchronous (as in
                you can watch a row and get a callback when its committed or superseded and see its previous versions
                and such) and mixed in with the <a href="post/16516763725.html" target="_blank">async batching</a> I described previously.  But its a generic thing and it
                could be synchronous.</p>
                <p>(Python is sorely lacking an ordered collection; I use one of the many native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree" target="_blank">tree</a>
                eggs out there, but this <em>really</em> ought to be part of the language runtime.)</p>
                <p>An issue becomes having several worker processes serving the same database.  The first approach
                to try is <em>don’t</em>.  The first rule of distribution is <em>don’t</em>. 
                <a href="post/18065079081.html" target="_blank">Cogs
                bad, remember</a>?  Sometimes though (and sooner if, like me, you use a lot of Python) you have to
                have multiple workers to sate the user demand to get at your data!</p>
                <p>In these circumstances, you normally use the database to serialize access.  As in all the
                workers can only scale sideways as much as the database can keep up.</p>
                <p>When you have the tables in RAM in each process instead, you have to start trying to keep them
                in sync.  At this point having a framework do this rather than having to roll your own is a big plus! 
                But its possible:</p>
                <p>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency" target="_blank">eventual
                consistency</a> is acceptable you can use message queues to do this (PostgreSQL 9 even has a <a href="https://taotetek.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/101/" target="_blank">pub-sub</a> system built
                in).  Or you can use another message queue.</p>
                <p>My mind races ahead and imagines using the normal cluster replication log stream from the real
                database being subscribed to by the web workers.  Or some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">Paxos</a>
                service.  The key thing is that despite writes being slow, reads are fast because reads are not going
                out-of-process.</p>
                <p>Just caching things in <a href="https://memcached.org/" target="_blank">memcached</a>
                is <a alt="dead link: http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/12/google-taming-the-long-latency-tail-when-more-machines-equal.html" href="/#404" target="_blank">much slower</a> than keeping an authoritative copy of them in-process. 
                Memcache comes into play when your dataset is much larger than the RAM of a single web-worker, and that’s
                just not true in the use-case I am describing here.</p>
                <p>Doing complex queries by the intersection of Python sets is pure pleasure and blazingly fast
                :)  If you are using a faster runtime, blazingly faster ;)</p>
