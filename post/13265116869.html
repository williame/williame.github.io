<post-body><div><span>I originally published this on an OS hobby site in 2004; as I started
                actually working as an engineer on an operating system at that time, I stopped publishing ideas as a
                hobby ;)</span><br/><br/>This article offers feature suggestions to budding OS
                developers looking for that neat edge.
                <p>Conventionally, each file on a computer system has a type. Different operating systems
                typically had different ways of working out the logical type of a file. UNIX uses a special flag to see
                if a file was ‘executable’, otherwise it is 'data’. Therefore,
                applications on UNIX have a variety of strategies for determining the file type. Some programs use the
                file extension as a hint (.jpeg is probably an image, for example) whereas others use more advanced
                heuristics (e.g. the UNIX 'file’ command) sometimes called 'magic’. MS-DOS and
                MS-Windows use the file extension to determine the type (.exe for executables, .txt for text files etc).
                More recent operating systems have embraced more recent classification systems such as MIME. In BeOS,
                for example, a server scans files and marks the MIME type of them in an attribute (basically caching the
                guess from the UNIX-style 'file’ heuristics) so that it can easily be looked at later. Almost
                all Internet content is marked with a MIME type (web pages, files received via email etc) and this can
                clearly indicate to the receiving computer the intended type of a file.</p>
                <p>Now let me introduce something slightly novel and new! Imagine that our new hobby operating
                system supports multi-stream files. Each stream in a file is a certain MIME type. Some of these streams
                might be generated programmatically on-the-fly, and basically encapsulate conversion. These programmatic
                streams allow plug-in filters and converters to be integrated into the operating system and used by
                programs. Let us explore what this might mean and how it might be used by programs:</p>
                <p>The operating system knows the actual MIME type of a file. It also has a list of programmatic
                stream plug-ins associated with each MIME type to handle the interpretation of a stream of one type into
                that of another. An obvious plug-in would be to filter text/html so that it was text/plain, stripping
                out the markup. Another plug-in might convert image/jpeg to image/gif. Another might extract the
                soundtrack of a movie file and present it as audio/wav.</p>
                <p>An application/x-idx file might have a programmatic stream of type text/gnu-makefile, while
                another programmatic stream might convert text/gnu-makefile streams into application/bash shell scripts.
                Therefore the operating system can string together these streams transparently, making an
                application/x-idx file executable in at a bash prompt.</p>
                <p>Encodings and character sets might also be incorporated into the same system, for on-the-fly
                conversion between various sets. A code snippet:</p>
                <p>FILE *f = fopen_ex(“ftp://stop.blogging.com/varfar/myos.zip/documents/filesystem.pdf”,“rb”,“text/html;charset=
                iso-8859-1”);</p>
                <p>A file selector dialog might have the file type set as a MIME type and display all documents
                that match a specific MIME type that the application understands without the application having to
                understand the conversion process.</p>
                <p>Most conversions are lossy ’ they remove information and meta-data, downgrading the
                quality of a source. Therefore, it is anticipated that almost all programmatic streams might be
                read-only. Many programmatic plug-ins’ might be easiest to implement if they support
                sequential access only. For this reason, it makes sense for the file selector dialog to be able to
                filter out streams with inappropriate access (e.g. only display application/ogg streams that are
                writeable and support random access). However, the opportunity is there for super plug-ins that
                facilitates content stored as one type to be completely edited as another, e.g. reading and writing to
                an application/ms-word file with an application that only understands application/x-multipart-html.</p>
                <p>Let me extend the idea even further. Not only might a file be multi-streamed, it might also be
                multi-part! Many file formats encapsulate multiple content parts ’ a movie has both image
                frames and a soundtrack; a rich document has text, drawing and images embedded; a mail message might
                contain a plain-text version, a rich text version or two and many attachments. An archive contains
                multiple files inside.</p>
                <p>Such files could be presented to programs as directories. You could now use your favorite
                drawing program to edit the individual frames of a movie!</p>
                <p>Directories themselves can have streams too. In the case of a virtual directory being generated
                from a single file, the directory’s stream would be the actual physical file (and programmatic
                streams that convert it). A conventional directory might have a text/html stream the serves the
                index.html file that it contains; another directory stream might provide a tar file of it and its
                children.</p>
                <p>Conversion libraries on most operating systems abound. Typically these libraries are
                fragmented, often unwieldy, often exposing technical details, and not pervasively used.</p>
                <p>A new hobby operating system has the opportunity to provide a uniform interface between
                applications and these conversion filters, in a way that is minimum effort for application programmers
                and in a way that is extendable (by providing more conversion filter plug-ins) without requiring extra
                code nor recompiling or re-linking of all applications. Placing this conversion into the way that files
                are provided to applications is, in my opinion, an excellent way to achieve this.</p>
                <p>Programmatic streams do not expose many parameters to tweak conversion and therefore do not
                completely replace the need for dedicated, detailed conversion libraries for dedicated programs. But
                they do further the usability of the average program in the normal operating scenario.</p>
