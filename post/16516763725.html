<post-body><p>As said in my <a href="post/16399069781.html" target="_self">moreSQL</a>
                article:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p><big>I found databases to be fastest when my own code buffers DB interaction and reorders
                things and coalesces things so the DB is getting a few queries each with more payload.</big></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>And I was rather disillusioned with ORMs.</p>
                <p>ORMs are about fast-prototyping code.  However, I discovered - in my DB usage patterns - that
                it was extra development cost when we discovered that the performance cost was prohibitive we had to
                chop it all out and replace it with a custom pattern.  It would have been massively faster development
                to just have done DB asynchronous in the first place…</p>
                <p>What I built is so generally applicable I offer it here as a useful pattern for your projects
                when you hit the same scaling issues we did:</p>
                <!-- more -->
                <p>I use asynchronous IO loop servers all the time.  Likely you do too.  I’ve used a lot
                of <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/" target="_blank">twisted</a> (so named because that’s
                what it does to your sanity), more recently <a alt="dead link: http://www.tornadoweb.org/" href="/#404" target="_blank">tornado</a>
                (saner and tidier; possibly abandon-ware, and the non-existent error-handling is surely malicious;
                rightly popular); I’ve contributed the inner IO loop to <a alt="dead link: http://incubator.apache.org/deft/" href="/#404" target="_blank">deft </a>and I’ve written my
                own <a href="https://github.com/williame/hellepoll" target="_blank">hellepoll</a> (leanest
                and meanest).  I haven’t used <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a>;
                that’s the one you’ve been using, right? :)  So that’s my CV and context.</p>
                <p>And if you are building an IO loop, you are likely still doing your DB blocking.  When your DB
                is slow, you’re told to just make your DB faster, or to spin your DB out to a separate server
                and bounce your DB calls via HTTP!</p>
                <p><img alt="dead link: http://img815.imageshack.us/img815/8805/20120126171105.jpg" src="/#404"/></p>
                <p>Doing blocking IO to the DB in an IO loop means your web-server goes as fast as the DB. 
                Requests that arrive whilst waiting for the DB to do its thing have to wait.</p>
                <p>You typically have several web-server instances and incoming requests are being load-balanced
                between them; so its a race which web-requests get serviced first; they can reach the DB in arbitrary
                order.</p>
                <p>Some IO loops come with a DB connection pool worker threads concept.  This means you can
                service non-DB-touching requests whilst the DB thread(s) are busy, but otherwise you get queued up. 
                This is a major improvement:</p>
                <p><img alt="dead link: http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/5633/20120127194726.jpg" src="/#404"/></p>
                <p>You have a thread pool of DB connection worker threads, each eating incoming requests,
                submitting them to the database, and then calling back to the web request when complete.  So the race
                between web requests can happen within the single server, and you have to be aware of that.</p>
                <p><sub>(I’ve heard more recently that tornado is adding or someone’s
                contributed something like twisted’s db connection pool with queues)</sub></p>
                <p>Now I had a particular app and it was using twisted’s db-connection-pool system, as
                above.</p>
                <p>I’ll bowdlerize a bit but imagine that lots of simultaneous web-requests all need the
                database to insert a row a database.</p>
                <p>Now this will typically mean each web-request makes a blocking call to the DB.  Or a blocking
                call to a NoSQL or memcache system - its all much the same here.</p>
                <p>In my tests, my MySQL+innodb instance running on local host could take about 1000 such discrete
                SQL INSERT statements per second (and every few minutes it paused for rather longer, which was very
                nasty for responsiveness!).  Your faster disks aren’t going to budge that number much.</p>
                <p>A single statement inserting all 1000 rows at once takes just milliseconds.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Basically, the throughput of the database is better measured in number
                of requests rather than size of those requests.</strong></em></p>
                <p>I speculate that its the row-count being returned that causes it to be sequential and slow. 
                Each statement is a request-response trip; it needs acknowledging before the DB connection handles its
                next request.</p>
                <p>Now at this point, we could have tried all kinds of things.  We don’t want to give up
                on ACID, and our code is already in the DB connection pool worker thread with callbacks architecture. 
                Our database is largely prescribed from outside.  So the thing we did try is novel and new though:</p>
                <p><img alt="dead link: http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/139/20120126171128.jpg" src="/#404"/></p>
                <p>I created a database worker queue that greedily ate the queued up statements (these statements
                were not SQL, but rather commands that it understood; they could have been SQL, but parsing SQL is not
                necessary if you write the code that submits to the queue too).  It then grouped them, sorted them, and
                turned them into just a few big SQL queries.  It executed them, put the corresponding callbacks into the
                main IO loop, and by this time there was a whole bunch more commands for it to reorder and coalesce.</p>
                <p><em><strong>The speedup comes by streaming to the DB rather than each individual
                statement from a web-request being an independent ping-pong.</strong></em></p>
                <p>On our hardware, INSERTs topped out at about 5K/sec sustained.  Obviously better hardware is
                available; on the other hand, some back-ends, especially shared or remote resources like Amazon EC2 has
                likely got substantially slower disk even.</p>
                <p>Now this is a high-cost initial start development-wise.  You have to know the
                application-specific data-specific reordering rules.  Is it safe to put this before that if the
                CustomerID is different, for example?  And there’s opportunities to spot and cope with writes
                that cancel others and normalizing them out before writing to DB.  You can mix updates with inserts
                using MySQL’s REPLACE INTO and so on, although decoding the rows-affected count afterwards
                takes some care.  You can even batch inserts that return IDs if you try super hard ;)</p>
                <p>I can imagine more general ways of inferring this, perhaps by standard annotations by the
                callee, but it does put a correctness strain on the developers.</p>
                <p>But oh boy was the performance worth it!  Absolutely no trouble making a single Python(!)
                server saturate both network IO and DB disk.</p>
                <p><em><strong>This design has exactly the same access schematics as the DB connection
                pool approach.  The only <big>ACID</big> you give up is a tiny bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID#Isolation">Isolation</a>.</strong></em></p>
                <p>By putting many statements into a single transaction, this breaks isolation.  As wikipedia
                says, I am not the first to do so.  Isolation is only broken if there is a validation error in some of
                the data; that would zap the other statements that chance put in the same transaction.  However,
                philosophically, if you consider a validation error from the DB to be a <em>programming error</em>,
                because you are doing your tainted validation client-side, then this can be no big loss.</p>
                <p>And you can obviously also have a pool of such workers.  But with that becomes diminishing
                returns because a single thread (even with GIL contention) is going to easily saturate your database :)</p>
                <p>From the perspective of each web-request, all statements happen in order if you have a single
                worker thread.  As each web-request must necessarily make no assumptions about the order of other
                independent web-requests, it is safe to reorder given the rules and constraints of your application.  (I
                don’t think this so straightforward to generalise; the code that decides the reordering rules
                has to grok the data.)</p>
                <p>I took this one step further and added an additional performance improvement: I found was that
                the set of hot SELECT data was sufficiently small in our application (you measure server RAM in GB these
                days) that it made sense to <a href="post/19346002203.html" target="_blank">store it Python-side</a>.  So SELECTs actually resolved completely client-side;
                its important to update the cache atomically when the write has succeeded on the DB, but its
                straightforward.  That’s obviously not super-scalable; but you’d be surprised how
                far that can take you.</p>
                <p>Still talking about Python specifically and most DB connections in general, they always push
                exceptions like the DB connection dying or a deadlock onto the caller.  And this is not the right
                decision.  The DB queue ought to contain the retry logic.  So I put that into mine; you’d have
                difficulty predicting the various transient error codes you can get back from MySQL; you learn them in
                production, sadly.</p>
                <p>Twisted’s db-api has a very nice feature where you can write a method to be executed
                in the context of the blocking DB thread, termed an interaction.  I use this quite a bit, so I made it
                that if the DB call fails because of these transient connection or deadlocking problems, my wrapper
                throws a special ‘rolling-back exception’ so the interaction code can clean up any
                non-DB state that it has modified.  More complexity, all worth it if you need the performance of
                asynchronous DB calls.</p>
                <p>I have not experimented with multiple transaction statements in a single request; I can imagine
                that working, and there being ways of inferring which transactions succeeded and which failed, so as not
                to lose a whole transaction if one component part fails.  However, I’ve always taken the
                strong position that the DB validation is for catching programming errors, not for catching bad input. 
                So you shouldn’t lose batches like that.</p>
                <p><em>So this is what I’ve been meaning by reordering and coalescing database
                reads at an application level.</em></p>
                <p>And to get it best, you have to know what the data is.</p>
                <p>If there was an ORM that was async, then perhaps - just perhaps - it could work on top of it.  
                If writing asynchronous IO looping code is second nature to you, so is understanding that the DB
                interaction is also spread out through many IO loop iterations.  And throughput and responsiveness times
                for requests that include DB access are massively faster when the server is under pathological load.</p>
                <p>You could also imagine an interesting blocking DB API built on top of Stackless Python
                perhaps?  I don’t know anything about Stackless, but I have a gut feeling its precisely for
                this.</p>
                <p>Its not a one-size fits all solution.  It did completely change the performance of our app,
                though.</p>
