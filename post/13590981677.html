                is a fast little webserver that I’ve made.  I’ve written a few little custom event
                loops like this over the years; this isn’t the first, and likely not the last.</p>
                <p>In the tightest HTTP handling code you have to handle pipelining and flushing.  This is the
                hellepoll secret:</p>
                <p><!-- more -->Normally, HTTP connections are kept alive and reused for many requests.  The
                only non-keep-alive connections you might see is if you are behind a particularly basic proxy (nginx
                stop blushing, people seem to forgive you) or if your client is actually a bit of app code running with
                some dead-simple HTTP client rather than a sophisticated browser.</p>
                <p>HTTP clients can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining" target="_blank" title="pipeline                 requests">pipeline requests</a> - that is, they can issue a request to fetch a
                page before previously-requested pages have been served.  The server has to reply in order, but can
                prepare pages to be sent rather than having to wait to process a request when previous requests are
                being served.</p>
                <p><img alt="HTTP pipelining from wikipedia" height="445" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/HTTP_pipelining2.svg/640px-HTTP_pipelining2.svg.png" width="640"/></p>
                <p>If you are using a blocking IO model, you have to really deal with each request in sequence;
                attempting to parse-ahead pipelined requests and juggle them will result in you writing a
                mini-asynchronous IO loop of your own and you might as well just bite the bullet and be asynchronous
                from the beginning… so asynchronous IO has a definite advantage in code organisation when
                trying to maximise performance of an HTTP stream.</p>
                <p>HTTP 1.1 clients must support chunked transfer encoding.  HTTP 1.0 may not.  As trunked
                transfer encoding simplifies replying to pipelining, I find it simpler to force connection-close on HTTP
                1.0 keep-alive requests that do not support it.  If you are writing to a connection-close stream you do
                not need to write-ahead the content-length which simplifies the house-keeping and buffering you might
                otherwise need to do.  HTTP 1.0 is really the domain of non-browser connections so this is fairly
                marginal (usually; of course, in your job, you might meet such connections repeatedly; sad).</p>
                <p>With chunked transfer you can write chunks as quickly as they are available - say one per call
                to some write() function - and even put many headers after the body.  You can’t rewrite the
                response code, however, so turning a 200 OK into some other error code after you’ve started
                writing to the socket is a no-no.</p>
                <p>The pipelined requests have to be written out in the strict order they were received which
                means if you are doing them in parallel you may need to buffer some writes until its the turn for their
                request.</p>
                <p>Fast TCP connections are really down to buffer management.  Inside the kernel, there is a read
                and write buffer associated with each socket; they are typically a few K.  Reading and writing into
                these buffers takes a system call, which is not free.  If you read these buffers one byte at a time you’ll
                end up with atrocious performance dominated by the cost of syscalls.  Once you set about trying to
                maximise performance, you start having to count syscalls and you start trying to keep the syscall count
                per connection down in the single digits.</p>
                <p>So you really need to buffer in your user-space for each socket, both reads and writes.  A
                single read-buffer is ideal but I’ve found putting the write buffers into a linked list when
                they can’t be written through to be effective.  My servers, handling strange things like
                messaging and video broadcasting and such have made efforts to share writable chunks between
                connections.  Eventually it will be possible to write on the socket, and at that point you can use
                writev() to send off as many buffers as possible in a single syscall.</p>
                <p>Browser support for gzipping of data offers exciting opportunities.  If you have lots of reused
                fragments you can pre-deflate these fragments - possibly using only Huffman, although patching up the
                offsets for matches is certainly viable - and writing them ready compressed whilst tagging dynamic data
                as uncompressed literals rather than expending CPU compressing them on the fly.  The more re-used your
                data and the slower your language choice the bigger the payoff - I’d imagine it an ideal
                speedup for Python-based multi-user chat servers, for example.</p>
                <p>Some clients use keep-alive connections but don’t pipeline.  In this case, when you
                write something, they’ll be waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" title="Nagle">Nagle</a>
                to kick in and actually send it over the wire before sending their next request.  <em>This means
                they will be slower than if they had connection-closed!</em>  In these circumstances, it is
                important to flush the write buffer immediately you have written the final part of the response if the
                connection is keep-alive and you haven’t already received the next pipelined request.  There
                is no nice ‘flush’ function, but you can achieve it by calling set_nodelay(true) and
                then calling set_nodelay(false) before any more writes.  This is two dreaded syscalls so its best to
                check for a pipelined request before invoking these.</p>
                <p>A non-blocking socket signals it is available for write every poll/select/epoll that you make
                even if you have nothing to write.  Edge-triggering is how you can prevent wasting time on sockets in
                this state and can give a comfortable speed boost.</p>
                <p>I haven’t taken more than a cursory glance at SPDY, but that glance says its
                pipelining++ and sequential chunks belonging to different requests can be written in any order.  It
                sounds delicious.</p>
