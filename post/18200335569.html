<post-body><p><a href="https://github.com/williame/hellepoll" target="_blank">Hellepoll</a>
                is the open-sourcing of a framework that was built for a live video transcoding and exploding server. 
                (Like <a href="https://www.wowza.com/" target="_blank">wowza</a> on steroids.)  Live video
                streams would come in and need transcoding to several formats, framerates and resolutions and then
                served up to a large number of clients who were are all getting the same video at the same time-point.</p>
                <p>Latency is the time gap between incoming video and outgoing video to all these clients, and it
                has to be in single-digit seconds.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->Video transcoding is one of those rare routine real-life problems that takes
                rather more cycles than anyone imagines.  You can have a completely normal incoming live video stream
                and the newest mid-range meaty server and all its cores will be busy with <em>just that one stream</em>. </p>
                <p>Exploding is where you take that one output and send that same packet to many connected
                clients; obviously, you need to try and not make unnecessary copies of the data for each client…</p>
                <p>After reviewing the media server landscape we decided we really needed to make our own.  Most
                of the servers we looked at were forking; forking is right for transcoding but not for expanding.</p>
                <p>As a consequence, hellepoll has a great <a href="post/13265364121.html" target="_blank">popen3</a>. 
                This is how it fired off video transcoding processes that would spread across the cores (and that
                themselves went multi-threaded/processed to utilize all cores).</p>
                <p>The expanding, though, is done by the asynchronous IO loop in a single hellepoll thread.  One
                thread is enough to saturate last year’s network stack.</p>
                <p>When you fire off a video transcoding process it itself fires off threads/processes to utilise
                all the cores on the machine (as specified by commandline switches).  But you might be transcoding more
                than one stream and the starting and stopping of transcoding streams is not synchronised.  Yet the
                transcoder doesn’t have system-wide knowledge.  I let the OS deal with juggling and planned to
                put load balancing of transcoding one level up by deciding which hellepoll node in the cloud would
                transcode any new incoming stream dynamically.</p>
                <p>I also worried that I’d still run out of CPU even for one stream, especially at high
                definition.  I imagined it might be workable to put hellepoll servers in serial with the first server
                filling in <a href="https://forum.digital-digest.com/f20/i-p-b-frames-explained-9785.html" target="_blank">I and P frames</a> at wide spacing and subsequent servers filling in b frames. 
                This would be a super-cool feat and well worth a few white papers :)  Luckily hellepoll never got this
                far and the pain of implementation details was never experienced ;)</p>
                <p>The IO loop in hellepoll was designed to be lean.  The clients were not talking HTTP but it was
                still TCP and all I’ve <a href="post/13590981677.html" target="_blank">said on HTTP</a> was refined on video streams.  The key exploding-focused part
                of hellepoll is its reference-counted buffers; one video frame can be kept around, reference counted,
                until all clients have consumed it.</p>
                <p>Hellepoll servers could be repeaters, exploding a stream coming from another hellepoll server
                but not needing to transcode it.</p>
                <p>We also stored the transcoded streams to disk.  The playing back of archived videos was done
                through some nginx servers sharing disk.  There could have been a whole CDN arrangement there but we
                never needed to move beyond nginx running on the same box.</p>
                <p>The writing of the streams to disk could have been done using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1825621/how-do-you-use-aio-and-epoll-together-in-a-single-event-loop" target="_blank">asynchronous file IO</a>.  Asynchronous network IO is readiness based - you get
                an event when something is buffered in the kernel waiting to be read, or when there is space in the
                kernel-side buffer to write to.  Asynchronous file IO is completion-based however - you tell the kernel
                to read or write some number of bytes, and get told when it has done so.  These can be combined, and I
                looked into how to do so but we got away with simple blocking file IO in our transcoding server. 
                Despite disk being slow, and despite log write and archive read contention, we didn’t saturate
                disk.  We might of got worryingly close though.</p>
                <p>That is why and how hellepoll was conceived.</p>
                <p>The HTTP handler in hellepoll was made the day before open-sourcing; without one, how would it
                have said ‘hello world’?</p>
