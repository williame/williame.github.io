<div class="post">
<post-body><p>Last Monday evening I got to look around, talk to and distract the <a href="https://www.copsub.com" target="_blank">Copenhagen Suborbitals</a> team in Copenhagen. 
                Mondays is their planning day and perhaps I was bit in the way but the project is their favourite
                subject so perhaps they appreciated a willing listener ;)</p>
                <p>They are an enthusiastic bunch of amateurs building a real proper space rocket!  They are
                aiming to launch a team-mate 100km straight up and bring them back down safely.  If I lived nearer I
                know I’d be sucked in and hopelessly trapped; there are like 20 or 40 of them or something and
                there’s people there every evening and often daytimes too and people are putting in 40+hours
                and stuff!  It reminds me of early accounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo_Aerospace" target="_blank">Armadillo Aerospace</a>.</p>
                <p>Here’s some old prototypes from their “museum corner”:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="333" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/102953980123_1.jpg"/></p>
                <p><!-- more -->And here’s a blown-up engine they have cut-away post-autospy:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/102953980123_2.jpg"/></p>
                <p>They had problems with their welds and are going to be using extrusion with help from some
                local engineering companies with fancy kit.  However, I was shocked by just how very precise I thought
                their welding and walling was!  They have two walls very evenly spaced and its a really remarkable bit
                of engineering in its own right.</p>
                <p>One of the fuels is alcohol and its piped to the ring at the bottom of the nozzle.  It then
                forces its way upwards - perhaps encouraged by capillary action? - towards the jet plate at the top. 
                There are some small bands of holes on the way up that let alcohol spray in to help cool it.  Apparently
                the roaring rocket motor only gets to 60<sup>o</sup>C externally so - if you dared be close
                enough - you could reach out and touch it!</p>
                <p>In the launch the seam burnt through causing a small explosion in the alcohol jacket - see the
                budge on the inside of the nozzle - before rupturing at the bottom and dumping the alcohol straight out
                the bottom for a fancy afterburner flame effect.  At least it was a spectacular failure! :DHere’s
                a look down the now-decidedly-banana-shaped rocket recovered from that launch:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="333" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/102953980123_3.jpg"/></p>
                <p>I found myself staring down that rocket casing lost in thought about the whole idea of being an
                astronaut :)</p>
                <p>They were originally using a very innovative hybrid rocket motor that burnt a combination of
                solid and liquid fuels.  Now they have split into two projects, one persuing the hybrid approach and the
                other team - which I visited - going for a liquid motor.</p>
                <p>Their shed is called the “Horizontal Assembly Building” which is a fun <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building" target="_blank">nod</a> to other
                endeavours.</p>
                <p>They are currently building a test stand for a small 5kn rocket to test the gimble system which
                will replace jet vanes in future motors.  Rather than small vanes deflecting the flow - which can impact
                thrust by 10 to 20% apparently - they will instead have a ball socket at the top of the chamber so the
                whole motor can move within the case.  There will be three or four pistons to steer the motor upto
                around 10<sup>o</sup>, and obviously the fuel pipes will need flexible hose sections.  Here’s
                the stand awaiting a paint job:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/102953980123_4.jpg"/></p>
                <p>The motor will sit horizontally in that and there will be a thrust sensor so they can see how
                much the rocket pushes and see that their gimbling works.  They have a motor test in January and I’d
                really like to come see it run.</p>
                <p>I had a fascinating talk about recovery and parachutes at mach 1.3 and things that are hard to
                really capture here; I can only encourage you all to go visit the website and the real site yourselves
                :D</p>
                <p>The project is some really real engineering by a very dedicated and capable team and I realy
                think they’ll actually get someone up into outer space some day.</p>
                <p>There is a closely related project that maintains a proper home-made submarine called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC3_Nautilus" target="_blank">Nautilus</a>.  This was
                outside in the yard - its undergoing a very thourough overhaul - and I found myself trying to take a
                photo of a black submarine on a dark night.  Anyway, here’s a bow-shot:</p>
