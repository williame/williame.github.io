<post-body><p>A lot of in-production phone crashes I’ve debugged over the years have
                crashed in error-handling code.  The error handling code itself is never as well tested as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path" target="_blank">happy path</a>.</p>
                <p>Hackers like working on tools and hackers are often attracted to writing test frameworks.  I
                know I was.  So while working at UIQ (we made a smartphone OS) I wrote a simple exhaustive exception
                generator.</p>
                <p>By hooking into <em>malloc</em> and file/network/IPC calls, I made them
                deterministically fail.  By starting the app and making allocation 1 fail, then restarting it and making
                allocation 2 fail and so on it found buckets of defects in the start-up code for the Symbian app
                framework.  Most of this code only worked on the happy path.  Symbian engineers loved the tool and
                zapped masses of broken cleanup code in app framework startup and it took them about one day to do it :)</p>
                <p>However, Opera refused to run it on the browser they were making for us.  Their excuse was that
                the browser was using Symbian’s ActiveObject asynchronous worker task framework; like all
                event-loops that relies on external events like files opening or IO this makes the run of the program
                quickly non-deterministic.</p>
                <p>Fair enough, we could fix that :)  Here’s how:</p>
                <p><!-- more -->By instrumenting the event loop code we made the scheduler examine the
                ready-to-run list each loop and decide the order to service them based on the coverage data it was
                tracking.  You can think of program flow as a big tree of possibilities based on the order that things
                happen.  The loop would know that its previously fired event 5 before 6 at iteration 12 and if there are
                more memory allocations to check in that path.  It could even pause slightly each iteration to give
                events a chance to fire if it has no non-exhausted paths to check.</p>
                <p>Still there is a massive branching factor; we rolled dice and never did get complete coverage
                on massive applications but we got real close on large applications and this was running in emulators,
                simulators and on phone hardware massively less powerful than todays devices and desktops.</p>
                <p><sub>I wonder if some of the ideas I have for <a href="post/17490392306.html" target="_blank">SameGame</a>
                can be applied?  That’s embargoed for now.</sub></p>
                <p>It seems a little bit obvious in retrospect, but at the time it was a big deal.  My data-point
                is that it <em>works</em>.</p>
                <p>Importantly we found hard-to-recreate but real bugs which we could recreate because we had the
                ‘path’ through the loop order; <strong>we found them before users found them,
                and we fixed them so users would never find them :)</strong></p>
                <p>Symbian was different from desktop operating systems in that requesting a page of memory
                actually reserved a page for you.  Desktop operating systems don’t actually do that; you can
                create a 100MB buffer or something and yet until you touch each page in that allocation the page isn’t
                there; it might not be there and you might get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGSEGV" target="_blank">SIGSEGV</a>/STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION.</p>
                <p>Of course memory allocations can only truly fail if they cross a page boundary and require a
                new page to be allocated, and there isn’t any free RAM.  But because there was lots of theming
                hooks very early in the app startup process on UIQ and because the memory allocations there were data
                determined and we had 3rd party themes, you really couldn’t know which actual allocations were
                crossing pages.  We wanted no crashes at all; we wanted to know we’d tested the app
                exhaustively.</p>
                <p>Applications are deterministic if you control their inputs exactly.  We were always on the
                watch-out for random input; luckily we didn’t have to contend with any that we knew of.  If an
                app had been seeding a random number generator with the system time it might have been solvable.  If the
                app was calling some external service such as NTP or a remote /dev/urandom -type thing or parsing live
                search results or otherwise getting random uncontrolled input from outside things would have been a bit
                harder.</p>
                <p><em><strong>This could be applied to the event loops of today</strong></em>,
                even if it focused on injecting IO disconnect errors in IPC/TCP and possibly file-not-founds.  It could
                also be applied to message-passing concurrency systems.</p>
                <p>It could <em>possibly</em> be applied to multi-threaded programs too, if a virtual
                machine (valgrind-like?) controlled shared memory access?</p>
                <p>We never did get Opera to actually run my tool though.  They had plenty of bugs they already
                knew about to be dealing with ;)</p>
