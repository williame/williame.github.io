<post-body><p>The newest r<a href="http://www.azspcs.net/" target="_blank">ec.math Al
                Zimmermann Programming Contest</a> is a solitaire Scrabble puzzle called ’<a href="http://www.azspcs.net/Contest/AlphabetCity" target="_blank">Alphabet City</a>’.</p>
                <p>Wait, what do you mean you’re not entering that programming contest??  Its a really
                really nice clean problem and it’s addictive as 2048!</p>
                <p>To lookup scrabble words quickly, people use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GADDAG" target="_blank">GADDAG</a>.  The GADDAG is a tree data-structure.  Each node represents a
                character, and has pointers to all the child nodes that continue all possible words.</p>
                <p>The key thing is that every rotation of each word is stored in the GADDAG.  To have a GADDAG of
                the words ALL, BALL and CALL, for each word we add all rotations.  This is LLA@, LA@L, A@LL for <em>ALL</em>,
                and LLAB@, LAB@L, AB@LL, B@ALL for <em>BALL</em> and so on.  (@ is my choice of ‘start-of-word’
                marker; its a good choice because in ASCII its the character before A.  When you have arrays of child
                nodes [A..Z], this can easily be extended to have a slot pointing at the start-of-word node [@..Z].  And
                it looks nice enough in the graphs too.)</p>
                <p>To speed up Scrabble searches, the prefix of each word is stored <em>reversed</em>
                which facilitates 'hook’ searches.  To search for all words with one letter then A then
                another empty then L (?A?L), you start with the first known letter - A - and look for all those with one
                character in front (a child with a @ child), terminated by an L.</p>
                <p>A naive sparse implementation of a GADDAG takes absolutely loads of memory: over a GB is not
                startling.  Almost all those nodes will be duplicates of other parts of the tree and almost all possible
                children will exist.  So we really want to get the memory usage down if we want to avoid our program
                waiting on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832" target="_blank">main memory</a>
                all the time: bottom cache is typically in the tens of nanoseconds away, whereas main memory is around a
                hundred nanoseconds away.  Getting the GADDAG small enough to fit into cache, even the bottom level
                cache (as in slowest and biggest), can mean an order of magnitude speedup!  So its well worth
                compressing your GADDAG.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/downloads/faster-scrabble-gordon.pdf" target="_blank">original
                paper</a> describes compression and gives an example of partial compression.  I will talk these
                through with graphs:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="518" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/87682811573_1.png"/></p>

                <p>Here’s the uncompressed tree.  Sorry it takes so much screen space .. it has a lot of
                nodes in it, which is a point I want to make :)</p>
                <p>3 words, 11 rotations and 27 nodes.</p>
                <p>Lets start compressing it:</p>
                <p>The first thing to note is that, unlike the ALL, BALL, CALL <a href="https://nullwords.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/gaddag-data-structure/" target="_blank">example</a> on
                NullWords blog, I am storing the terminating characters (the blue nodes) in a separate set off the node.
                 This is how the prefix LLA is followed by a single node with both B and C in it.</p>
                <p><!-- more --></p>
                <p>That aside, you can see a lot of obvious repetition in the tree.  The <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/downloads/faster-scrabble-gordon.pdf" target="_blank">original paper</a>
                had a recipe for a partial compression as you build the GADDAG: for each word, you merge the suffix of
                the rotations.  It looks like this:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="518" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/87682811573_2.png"/></p>

                <p>We still have 25 nodes!  We’ve only saved 2 nodes.  This is not a fair example,
                however: in the full contest wordlist (172,820 words, 1,570,604 rotations and 32,13,156 nodes) this
                partial optimisation gets it down to just 1,534,313 nodes.</p>
                <p>So how small do we want to go?  My laptop has a pretty decent 6MB of L3 cache.  If we can get
                the whole GADDAG in under 6MB, we’ll avoid hitting main memory <em>ever</em>.
                 (Cache line collisions ignored.)</p>
                <p>So we can still see we have lots and lots of duplication.  The @ node is often followed by L,
                for example.  In order to merge these tails, we have to first build the uncompressed graph (partial
                compression during load helps speed things up though) and then compare nodes.  Nodes are the same if
                their children have the same values and their terminating character set is the same.  To find these, I
                simply sorted all nodes using a deep comparison.  Here’s all the identical tails merged:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="370" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/87682811573_3.png"/></p>
                <p>Now we’re down to just 17 nodes!  You can still walk the tree in the same way: its
                the exact same tree, only duplication removed.</p>
                <p>For the contest wordlist we now have only 533,173 nodes!  So 3x less nodes than the partial
                compression.  And a lose packing of these nodes and their links (using an int32 array, rather than
                byte-packing) weighs in at 6.3MB.  Just a bit too big for my L3 cache, so we need to compress more.</p>
                <p>At this point its worth describing how to actually pack the tree into an array.  We want an
                array of int32 because we its nice and fast to access.  You can pack tighter if you go to bytes (e.g.
                address of other nodes can use just 3 bytes instead of 4), but this means some more twiddling while
                walking the tree: its worth it if you have only 2MB L2/L3 though!</p>
                <p>So each node can be an int32.  The two high bits are boolean flags to say if the node has
                terminators and if the node has children.  If the node has terminators then the terminators are stored
                in the low 26 bits of the first int32, and any children will have bits set in the next int32.  The
                children int32 has a bit set for each present child.  And then the address of the children follow.</p>
                <p>In the optimised tree there are 533,173 unique nodes with 979,160 links.  48,246 nodes have
                terminators and 137,905 don’t.  29,506 nodes have only one link and terminators, and 316,364
                nodes have a single child link and no terminators. 1,152 nodes have only terminators.</p>
                <p>As so many nodes have only one child link, you can pack this even tighter if you have a third
                high bit flag on the first word to mark that the node has only a single child, and then pack the ordinal
                of the child and its offset into the remainder of the header int32.</p>
                <p>Here’s a diagram of my format:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/87682811573_4.png"/></p>

                <p>Three types of node are shown.  The first three bits in the first int describe which fields are
                present.  If there are terminators, the bit mask of terminating characters is in the first int.  The bit
                mask for multiple children is in the first available int, which will also be the first if there are no
                terminators.  If a node has only one character, it can be packed into a single int.  You can of course
                have a node with a single child and some terminators, which takes two ints (not shown).</p>
                <p>To determine if a node has a particular child is easy with a bit mask.  To work out the address
                of a child, though, you have to iterate over the bit mask of multiple children.  Modern fast CPUs have
                ops - available via C intrinsics like <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Other-Builtins.html" target="_blank">__builtin_ffs()</a>,
                but you’re still walking them.  One idea is to actually use a different ordered alphabet: if
                instead of A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on you reorder the letters so that the most common children are sooner,
                you might get a small speed boost.</p>
                <p>Often GADDAGs seem to be packed more tightly still (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/cdhowie/Quackle/blob/master/gaddag.h" target="_blank">Quackle</a>) by
                having a marker bit in each int32 to say if it is the first child pointer in node, or a continuation.</p>
                <p>However, I  prefer bit-fields because it speeds up searching significantly.  As you walk over
                free tiles you can turn your rack into a single int32 mask which you can then AND with the bit-field in
                the header to see if letters in the rack are continuations of the word.</p>
                <p>And if you have access to the C intrinsics you can mask out the higher bits of the child you
                want the index of and popcount() it.  This is branchless.  So it saves you doing lots of walking over
                child nodes doing if-statements on each one.</p>
                <p>Still, if you have only 2MB L2, tighter packing may pay off big-time.  As fellow Mill CPU team <a href="https://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/8" target="_blank">Terje Mathisen</a> says, &quot;almost
                all programming can be viewed as an exercise in caching&quot;.</p>
                <p><strong>The thing is, we’re still missing a massive trick:</strong></p>
                <p>When you walk the tree, you know before visiting a child what its character is.  You’ll
                see above that I don’t actually store the character in the node.</p>
                <p>So nodes that were originally built for completely different characters and yet have the same
                exit branches (and those exit branches have the same exit branches and so on) can be merged!  Feast your
                eyes on this beauty:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="246" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/87682811573_5.png"/></p>
                <p>Now the ALL, BALL, CALL is down to just 12 nodes!  The red arrows show an exit vector that is
                different from the node that it arriving at; fundamentally, the next character is a function of the edge
                you travel not the node you arrive at.</p>
                <p>Its hard to believe that actually this is the exact same GADDAG as the original diagram at the
                top of this post!  But its true.</p>
                <p>For the contest word list, its now down to just 419,264 nodes and 811,985 links.</p>
                <p>We can also - obviously - omit words in the dictionary that are longer than 15 characters, as
                the Scrabble board is only 15 characters.  In the final GADDAG there are 168,548 words, 1,497,605
                rotations and 2,994,373 logically nodes.  But with compression, there are only 391,101 unique nodes and
                774,216 links.  33,255 nodes have terminators and 122,012 don’t. 18,780 nodes have only one
                child link and terminators, and 216,702 have just the one link and no terminators.  This compresses to
                … <strong>under 4MB</strong> :D</p>
                <p>Good luck in the contest you too ;)</p>
