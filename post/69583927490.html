    <p><b>I have always loved programming</b> - its like Lego without gravity.</p>
    <p>Basic on my ZX81 graduating to assembler and Turbo Pascal during my teens.</p>
    <p>Developed phone OS software - engineer, architect, product manager - but got made irrelevant by the
        iPhone and redundant by Android.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16pt; width:90%;">These days I mostly work with <b>data</b>, <b>big data</b> and <b><i>fitting big data onto small boxes</i></b>.</p>

<div class="post">
<post-body><p>I was packing away an old unused computer that I’d been letting my
                daughters <a href="post/19500788060.html">play
                with</a> - they have more modern laptops <a href="post/49786413417.html">now</a> - when
                I realised it was the last computer I had with a floppy disk drive!</p>
                <p>So I went out to my storage and found whole stack of old floppies.  These date from about 2000
                until 2004; sadly nothing from school days nor uni :(</p>
                <p>The internet was still young, then, and whilst I’d got my first dial-up when at uni
                it wasn’t until my work life started properly in Gamla Stan, Stockholm that I had real
                internet access.  Online there was an extensive game modding community, and the internet was a nice
                safe-feeling fun-feeling exciting place to hang out.  I’ve never been a big game player, but I’ve
                always been a big hobby game maker.</p>
                <p>One of my projects then was making modding tools for the Command &amp; Conquer Tiberian Sun
                game.  I’d been making voxel editors at uni, but by the year 2000 the source to the first
                voxel editor had been lost, and I’d had to make a second voxel editor.</p>
                <p>The Tiberian Sun units were stored as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxels</a>
                - think of them as tiny cubes arranged to approximate a 3D representation - and my editors were the
                first user-friendly editor attempts for them.  They really opened up what was possible for modders, who
                adopted my tools - inadequacies and all - with glee.</p>
                <p>The <a href="post/30793134312.html">usual</a>
                <a href="post/53831974133.html">suspect</a> started
                making mods using the tools.  It was really his mods that made me make the tools, really.  In fact his
                interest came first.</p>
                <p>Later I started on an INI editor, which I modeled on the VB6 and Delphi IDEs.  And I made a SHP
                editor, SHP being the RLE-compressed image format used for buildings and ground tiles and such.</p>
                <p>The fun thing about the IDE is how its a list-box with a custom item drawer, and there’s
                a borderless text-edit control positioned over the current line.  Parsing of the line is deferred until
                you leave the line.  This works really really well, actually :)  I don’t think I ever started
                on cut-n-paste though.</p>
                <p>The key thing with the screenshots above is that they were all Delphi apps.  They ran on
                Windows 95 or 98 or NT, and they are tiny self-contained little executables without dependencies.  Wine
                runs them on my mac just fine.</p>
                <p>I also had some C++ (usually wxWidgets) apps too.  But I haven’t been able to run any
                of them with Wine because they load DLLs that Wine doesn’t have, and I can no longer compile
                them because of incompatibilities with newer wxWidgets headers and widechar issues that I made only
                five-second-evaluation attempts to fix.</p>
                <p>I also wrote a fast export script for 3DSMax.  Not very screenshot-able, but that was used by a
                Dutch modder who was a proper professional 3D chap.</p>
                <p>The very sad thing is all the projects that are pre 2000 that I seem to have no record left of.
                 I remember making maze wandering games and point-and-click adventures for DOS back in the 90s while at
                school, and I’d dearly love to see them and the usual suspect’s artwork for them
                again.</p>
                <p>But all in all, very happy memories :)  And now on a USB stick.  In a decade I’ll
                doubtless be throwing away my last computer with a USB jack, and hopefully I’ll remember to
                copy and rummage around in my old projects :)</p>
