                followers of the blog know (thx for the mails!), I’ve been making mosaics of <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> <a alt="dead link: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/05/01/your-game-here-2/" href="/#404" target="_blank">contest entries</a>.
                 It <a href="post/71966020187.html">started</a>
                <a href="post/84225291373.html">basic</a>,
                and its got <a href="post/84317701363.html">better</a>.
                 Each of the ‘pixels’ in the Mona Lisa is actually a screenshot of a game!  <em><strong>Here’s
                how</strong></em>:</p>
                <p>We have an target image, for example the Mona Lisa, and we have some large number of small
                input images which we want to arrange so that, when squinted at from a distance, it approximates the
                target image.</p>
                <p><!-- more --></p>
                <p><em><strong>Tiling</strong></em></p>
                <p>The first step is to determine the tiling of the input images.  I wanted all images to be a
                uniform size.  But the small input images are a variety of sizes.  So I averaged their aspect ratio.
                 Aspect ratio is width / height, and is a floating point number (so be careful of integer / integer
                which usually gives integer!)</p>
                <p>Some images will be distorted more than others when they are scaled to the output tile size,
                but so be it.  Packing non-uniform-sized images is non-trivial - we can’t even decide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing" target="_blank">how best</a> to stack
                oranges ;)</p>
                <p> Its then to decide an arbitrary width for the input image; the height will be derived from the
                average aspect ratio.  Lets call this thumb_width and thumb_height.</p>
                <p>So we have some number of input images, and we want to work out how many rows and how many
                columns best fit.  The simple way is to start with 1 row and 1 column, and add a row or column -
                whichever is closest to the aspect ratio of the output image - until rows x columns is more than the
                number of input images:</p>
                <pre><code>
                target_aspect_ratio = target_width / target_height
                rows = cols = 1
                aspect = thumb_width / thumb_height
                while rows * cols &lt; num_images:
                add_col_aspect = ((cols + 1) * thumb_width) / (num_images / (cols + 1))
                if abs(add_col_aspect - target_aspect_ratio) &lt; abs(aspect - target_aspect_ratio):
                cols += 1
                aspect = add_col_aspect
                else:
                rows += 1
                </code></pre>
                <p>(When working in Python, it’s important to ensure you get floats from those divides;
                in the real code, I wrap the lhs with float())</p>
                <p>So now we know we have a grid of cols*rows tiles to place.  There may be more grid spots than
                source images, and you can decide what to do with those extra tiles.  You may add finesse by choosing to
                add the very last row or column based on which leaves the least empty tiles, although I chose aspect
                ratio over minimizing empties.</p>
                <p>And you have some options with how to present those empty tiles in the final output image.  I
                decided to make them black, and not to account for this blackness in the image matching described below.
                 You may decide to copy in the original target image into those empty tiles, or whatever.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Matching / Scoring / Fitness</strong></em></p>
                <p>Now we know the source image grid we have to determine how well each input image matches each
                tile in the target image.</p>
                <p>The simplest approach is Mean Square Error (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSE" target="_blank">MSE</a>).  To compute the MSE for a thumb, you scale target image and the thumb
                and then compute the squared Euclidean distance of each corresponding pixel. You then average these
                squared distances to get the mean, but if you think about it there’s a fixed number of pixels
                in this grid we are using so we can skip the Mean -part of the calculation.</p>
                <p>I did this on a 'patch’ scale, so a few hundred samples per thumb per tile.  I didn’t
                really experiment nor reason about how many samples per thumb per tile would be optimal.  The number of
                samples per thumb per tile has a direct linear outcome on the time it takes to compute all the
                similarities, so you can trade speed for accuracy here.</p>
                <p>There are better approaches to image similarity, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSNR" target="_blank">PSNR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank">SSIM</a>.  SSIM tries
                to capture the structural similarity too, which sounds like a good thing.  A simple MSE doesn’t
                quite capture contour matching.  You could also investigate merging scores from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection" target="_blank">edge detection</a> into the
                fitness metric e.g. mix in the MSE of the Sorbel or Canny filter of the image too.</p>
                <p>You also have to pick the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space" target="_blank">colour
                space</a>.  I chose RGB.  This may not be a very good choice.  There are probably better colour
                spaces to use that more closely approximate how humans perceive colours.</p>
                <p>This is really not practicing what I preach; I’ve been guilty of reading Charles
                Blooms blog, and commenting on StackOverflow about image matching metrics, and worked a lot with video
                transcoding and stuff, and yet when making my quick and dirty script I took the quick and dirty
                approaches.</p>
                <p>The actual computation of the match for each thumb with each tile can take a considerable time.
                 Its embarrassingly parallel, but I did not invest the time in making Python parallelize it.  I could
                have speeded up the actual computation using numpy, which has a MSE function too, and I could have tried
                to use multiprocessing to do things in parallel (although pushing bytes to each worker is significant
                overhead and work would need to be invested in ensuring the underlying bitmaps were shared).  I just
                made it so that the MSE results were serialized (and gzipped; the cartesian product of all thumbs and
                all tiles is quite a lot of data) so that the scores could be re-used as I tweaked the placement
                algorithm.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Placement</strong></em></p>
                <p>Once you have some score for how similar each thumb is with each tile, you have to decide how
                to place them!</p>
                <p>The simplest approach is ’<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm" target="_blank">greedy</a></strong>’.
                 That is, you place the closest-matching thumb on its best tile.  And then the next and the next.</p>
                <p><img align="right" alt="image" data-orig-height="160" data-orig-width="100" src="media/old/84505278488_2.jpg"/>One
                way to implement this is to put each match score, tile and thumb into a list and sort it so best score
                is first.  Then you iterate through this list, and if the tile is still unoccupied and the thumb still
                unplaced, you place it.  Even in Python, it takes just a few seconds.  Here’s the result on
                the right →</p>
                <p>Why all those white blocks?  Well, in the mona lisa there isn’t any very white tiles,
                but we have lots of very white thumbs to place.  There are patches of skin in the source image that are
                white-ish, but we also have some skin-coloured tiles that are much closer matches and which we’ve
                already placed.</p>
                <p>When placing greedily, we quickly place the very closest matches.  This leaves us with the
                increasingly poorly matched tiles and thumbs.  The end result is that the last-placed tiles are the
                worst possible matches!</p>
                <p>After the first Ludum Dare contest, I left it here.  But when I run the mosaic script on the
                newest contest thumbnails, I was unimpressed and itched to fix this.</p>
                <p><img align="right" alt="image" data-orig-height="157" data-orig-width="100" src="media/old/84505278488_3.jpg"/>What’s
                the quickest possible fix?  Take the output of the greedy algorithm and add <strong>Random Swaps</strong>.
                 You pick two placements at random and compute if swapping them lowers the <em>overall</em>
                image similarity score.  And you make as many swap improvements as you can find, until the person
                running the script gets tired of waiting and interrupts.  I called this the 'timed’ algorithm
                in the script.  Result on the right again :) →</p>
                <p><a alt="dead link: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/05/01/your-game-here-2" href="/#404" target="_blank"><strong>Hi-Res</strong>
                images here</a>.</p>
                <p>So those pesky white thumbnails have migrated to her skin patches because whilst there are
                closer skin-coloured matches, placing a skin-coloured patch on the black cloth is less overall error
                than placing the very white.  And so, with time and millions of random swap checks and thousands of
                actual improving swaps, tiles migrate towards a global optimum.</p>
                <p>This is missing a few tricks.  There might be three tiles A B and C which, when their
                placements are rotated, lowers the overall score.  However, none of the pairs A B, B C nor A C are
                themselves a better swap.  This pair swapping algorithm will not find these.</p>
                <p>When entering <a href="http://www.azspcs.net/" target="_blank">rec.math contests</a>,
                I would start thinking about how to better optimize placement.  But as it is, random swaps actually
                works quite well.  I’d love to hear your ideas for improvements!</p>
