                <p>I’m just back from <a href="http://2014.pycon.se/" target="_blank">pycon 2014
                Sweden</a>.</p>
                <p>And all the tweets and commentary will be positive, as they <em>always</em> are. If
                you want to say something negative its best to not say it at all?</p>
                <p>Hmm, not me.  Someone has to give this feedback; we can’t sweep it under the carpet.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->First, <strong>the good bits:</strong></p>
                <p>James Powell’s talk on embedding CPython in CPython was … fascinating!
                 Whilst the whole point of the exercise is questionable, to say the least, his infectious enthusiasm,
                pace and style really got the audience swinging.</p>
                <p>Kenneth Reitz’s talk on Python 2 vs Python 3 - nobody’s using Python 3, and
                Kenneth thinks we have to start or we’ll lose our beloved Python - was super interesting to
                everybody.  OK, so his actual slides were, well, hmm, silly… really, the whole evolution
                angle was so riddled with false analogies that the first half of the talk would have been better
                skipped.  But by the end he had everyone’s attention about such a sensitive and important
                topic that affects us all.  If &lt;5% of users are using Python 3, just who have the Python core
                devs been working for these past five years?</p>
                <p>Laurens Van Houtven’s crypto 101 talk was also fascinating.  OK, so he knows that
                even his claim that Twisted validates certs is questionable in the aftermath of the heartbleed
                mass-revocation, but I think if he can get everyone to use TLS always, we’ll stand a better
                chance of upgrading that when we’ve secured it (the whole CA angle, which I’ve been
                fascinated by for ages, seems less tractable than the cipher issues and I didn’t buy his
                dismissal of RC4 either) is a tad higher?</p>
                <p>So these are the international speaker circuit.  They do these trips and give these talks
                because they are good at them.  But the lesson isn’t to only use tried-and-tested
                international speakers, because <em>all</em> the lightning talk slots were fascinating too.
                 The audience was technical, and when the audience put themselves forward to present, they had something
                to say that was interesting to the audience.  The audience were full of good potential future talks for
                next year.</p>
                <p>And the first keynote, by Helena Bengtsson, was interesting too.  Nothing python-related
                really, and she only talked about the <em>why</em> not the how, but investigative journalism
                is interesting and the audience enjoyed it.</p>
                <p><strong>Still good:</strong></p>
                <p>Isaac Bernat’s talk was a good talk but could have had more <em>how</em>
                and less <em>why</em>.  Questions got a bit caught up in the need to abort builds if there
                are TODOs in them, which is a shame because there’d have been a lot of good talking to be had
                about how he pipes together things in bash, and perhaps why he doesn’t use multiprocessing to
                pipe together tools and filters instead.</p>
                <p>And Beatrice Åkerblom’s research into dynamic languages and counting
                the occurrences of dynamic usage in a Python corpus was interesting.  The subject matter deeply
                interests me so I perhaps paid closer attention than others.  He delivery was a bit non-committal, and
                if she’s been at it since SourceForge was mainstream then I hope she’s been busy
                with other things because she showed what you can get from a few days effort.  Her results also
                surprised me, but there’s a few things I’ve learned from my attempts at statifying
                Python that might mislead results, namely the duckability of truthiness, collections and so on, and the
                re-use of variables that, when thought about using <a href="post/15203221199.html">SSTA</a>,
                goes away.</p>
                <p>Attendees are doubtless tying to work out by my omissions what I thought was <em>bad…</em></p>
                <p><strong>The Bad bits:</strong></p>
                <p>A couple of talks simply weren’t right.</p>
                <p>I’m not sure why Jack Palmer came to talk about his startup plot.ly but he sure did
                just read the slides and drown the audience in apathy.  He brightened up and acted sharp to questions,
                so he’s got passion for the subject deep down, but it completely hid during his main
                presentation.  A shame.  Not everyone is a born presenter.</p>
                <p>The worst though was Jacqueline Kazil.  I mean, what on earth was her point?  I trust our
                ticket money didn’t fund her trip!  And after a sequence of disjoint incomplete slides - the
                only highlights being photos she’d inserted of other people’s talks - she goes and
                finishes super early.  No questions from the audience… so there you go, I think she got the
                message.</p>
                <p><strong>But the worst bit?</strong></p>
                <p>The waiting around.  The schedule had absolutely massive wastelands of waiting.  The lunch
                break alone was scheduled for 2 hours.  And when Kazil finished super early, there was even a wait for
                the food.</p>
                <p>Programmers are not a social bunch, and not good at <strike>smalltalk</strike>
                small talk.  Those that came with buddies clustered around them and talked to their buddies.  Those that
                travelled alone stood alone, waiting.  Everyone had their arms crossed and even the organizers -
                programmers, obviously - exhibited this behaviour.</p>
                <p>And I don’t think you can really blame us programmers for this.  We aren’t
                going to get a crash course on polite conversation with strangers simply by having to endure two hour
                waits.</p>
                <p>Kenneth Reitz’s audience polling showed that the audience were firmly experienced
                programmers and really none of the “Python is my first language” people that -
                apparently, I haven’t met them - exist.  There was very little scientist angle, and very all
                the journalists were speakers not audience.  So know the audience!  The audience wanted pure uncensored
                programming, and didn’t really get it.  The just got long awkward waits. </p>
                <p>The lightning talks showed the crowd was full of people with interesting things to share and
                say.  The lightning talks, if they’d allowed for questions, would have been excellent at four
                times the allotted time.</p>
                <p>If the schedule had been over full and over technical, and everyone rushing and hurrying, I
                think the buzz would have built and <em>then</em> programmers would have started getting
                social.</p>
                <p>I have a dirty little secret: when faced with a 150 minute wait on the second day after Kazil’s
                piss poor talk, I just waited long enough for the baguettes to arrive before strolling off into the
                Stockholm sunshine and going to see the town.  Stockholm is a super-lovely pretty town, with a
                super-safe feeling as you wander around.  Well recommend visiting.  If you’ve never seen the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)" target="_blank">Vasa</a>, you really
                really really should.</p>
                <p>I’d have liked to see the Machine Learning talk, but I’ve already seen it
                on youtube from the main pycon, and it finished at 6 which would have been hard on the airport journey,
                so I reluctantly skipped it.  My feedback would be “please give the same talk next year, but
                use <a href="post/15581427232.html">Collaborative
                Filtering</a>” ;)</p>
                <p><strong>So, next year…</strong></p>
                <p>Much more <em>technical</em> talks.  No real breaks.  Much more rushing around and
                bustle.  If everyone complains they couldn’t see it all, and that they finished exhausted,
                that’s a <em>good</em> conference!</p>
