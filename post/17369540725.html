<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>Sometimes I start to write, or at least start to think about writing, computer
                games.  I find the engine writing attractive.  I’m sitting on a few great game ideas; oh to
                have the financial freedom to go be an indie game maker!</p>
                <p>As I start to write the game I find my mind inexplicably drawn by technical details.</p>
                <p>One technical detail that I’m inexplicably drawn to each time is how to compress the
                artwork.  I reckon that games could be <strong>compressed 3x better</strong>:</p>
                <p><a href="http://megaglest.org/" target="_blank"><!-- more -->Glest</a> is a
                great open source game with a vibrant and active modding community.  Its a good example that I’ve
                studied.</p>
                <p>A Glest mod may be anywhere between 20 and 200MB, as zipped by 7-zip.  That’s a lot
                of bytes to download.</p>
                <p>About 40% of that is the 3D model mesh format (Glest has its own called G3D) and the other 60%
                is the textures to go on those models.  Some mods have non-trivial quanities of OGG music, which I’ll
                ignore for the rest of this article.  (And the configuration files (Glest uses XML) really don’t
                count for anything bytewise.)</p>
                <p>The G3D model format is keyframe-based vertex animation.  Its just like id’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD2_%28file_format%29" target="_blank">MD2</a>/MD3, which
                they used in Quake II.</p>
                <p>Each model is made from meshes.  Each mesh has a number of frames, and for each frame it stores
                the vertices and normals and texture coordinates.  It stores an index array describing the triangles to
                make from these verices too; it stores only one copy of this, which is used for all frames.</p>
                <p>The absolute first step is to move to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation" target="_blank">bones animation</a>
                system instead.  In a bones animation you have a list of vertices and and index describing how to join
                vertices to make triangles.  For each vertex you attach to one or a handful of bones by different
                weights.  You can compute the position of each vertex for any given time point by moving the bones.  id
                moved to bones for Doom III (MD5 format).</p>
                <p>Bone animations take substantially less space.  its as simple as that.  You only have to store
                the vertices for one ‘frame’.  They are also naturally how most authoring tools
                work, so its perhaps <em>less</em> of a burden on the creator.</p>
                <p>Key-frame based vertex interpolation is perhaps slightly faster to draw, but at the cost of
                massively more memory both on-disk and in-game.</p>
                <p>Now you’ve got just one list of vertex positions and normals, you can dramatically
                cut this down further.</p>
                <p>You can optimise the mesh to in-game size.  I’ve seen 3D models in Glest that you
                could render as a point cloud!  There’s no need for detail that isn’t discernible or
                necessary when drawn in-game.  But this is lossy; I’d rather steer away from making judgements
                on artwork; that’s for the artist.  If they give us a ridiculously high-poly model, we have to
                take it.</p>
                <p><img align="left" height="210" src="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/9290/landship1.jpg" width="240"/>Many models contain massive amounts of symmetry.  You can note that the left side of the
                torso mesh is the same as the right but mirrored, and just store the left side and instructions to
                mirror it to create the right side.  This is not, of course, universally true.  But the vast majority of
                Glest-style models could be halved.  You can do this on a sub-mesh basis.</p>
                <p><img align="right" alt="Some legs under the cloak that are just not needed" height="240" src="http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6013/glest3.png" width="320"/></p>
                <p>Hidden surface removal often relies on knowing about the constraints of the camera in the
                destination game.  In glest, for example, the undersides of models will never see the light of day.</p>
                <p>To the right here is a model with hidden surfaces (green) as found by a Python script I wrote
                to test this -&gt;</p>
                <p>You can usually save space by moving to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_strip" target="_blank">triangle strips</a> instead
                of triangles.  There are tools to do this from Nvidia, ATI and others; I have played with the excellent
                <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~stripe/stripev2.html" target="_blank">stripe</a>.  This
                will more than half your file without affecting your ability to do further compression.</p>
                <p>Many models use auto-normals.  Or the auto-normals are close enough in most cases.  If you
                compute the auto-normals and store the diff to the actual normal, rounded to some precision (MD5, for
                example, only stores normals to a precision of a couple of decimal points), then you can often get lots
                of 0’s and such which will compress nicely when we compress the tiny mesh file we now have.</p>
                <p>We’ve moved to bones animation, we’ve zapped hidden surfaces, we’re
                only storing one half of mirrored meshes and we’re using delta-to-auto normals.  And now we
                compress this output file.  It doesn’t matter if the file is a binary format or a text format;
                they compress about the same if you’re using normal compression e.g. zip/7-zip/LZO etc.</p>
                <p>However, if you move on to compression by <em>prediction</em>, meshes are rather
                interesting.  <strong>If all the points in a mesh were truely random, the model would be a spikey
                ball</strong>.  Real models have rather constrained vertex positions and this could be modeled. 
                However, as long as we stay away from compression by prediction we have great runtime performance; as
                soon as we go this route we’re likely to blow any runtime loading budget.  It might be
                interesting to download and decompress and store the decompressed meshes locally perhaps instead?  I’ve
                read the papers on predicting vertex positions that I’ve found on Google but I haven’t
                tried implementing anything so I can’t be as sure how much it helps relative to how much it
                slows.  Also, it occurs to me that vertices are most likely to be attached to bones that are near them
                and their neighbours, and I haven’t seen any papers discussing modeling that.</p>
                <p><strong>Compressing compressed textures</strong></p>
                <p>Update: <a href="http://cbloomrants.blogspot.se/2012/04/04-05-12-dxt-is-not-enough-part-2.html" target="_blank">excellent
                expert analysis</a></p>
                <p>I’ve mostly concentrated on compressing meshes so my ideas on compressing the
                textures - and even modeling that compression on the mesh that we know they fit - has not really been
                experimented with.  So I’ll list my ideas a bit more briefly and with less conviction:</p>
                <p><img align="left" height="256" src="http://img600.imageshack.us/img600/8430/textureworker.jpg" width="256"/>Often, especially where
                we have corresponding mirroring in the mesh, we have corresponding mirroring in the texture maps. 
                (Mirroring of texture coordinates for meshes kind of relies on this,)  Looking at the texture map for a
                model is often full of striking symmetry.  You could simply store half and note how and where to mirror,
                or you could go further and rewrite the texture coordinates in the model to re-use the exact same texels
                but mirrored.</p>
                <p>Sometimes textures are lossy compressed but that really has to be an artist choice again; you
                can’t go JPGing texture maps (you can have grayscale JPGs for alpha channel) automatically
                really.  Texture compression e.g. DDS/PVRTC/ATITC etc is again an artist choice.</p>
                <p>It is exciting to wonder if <a href="http://kdepepo.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/fast-lossless-color-image-compression/" target="_blank">iz
                compression</a> can be applied to compressed textures; it is said to be comparable to PNG on
                ratio, but at least 2x faster to decode i.e. load!</p>
                <p>Textures are often pre-mip-mapped and when you have a mip-mapped image you one of the levels to
                compress the others.</p>
                <p>Texture, light maps, normal maps and such are often the exact same layout as each other.  If
                you treat them as a whole and use one to model another you can likely get much better compression ratio
                than treating each as an isolated individual.</p>
                <p>So, in this way, I think you can use less than a third as much bandwidth and disk space to
                store the exact same 3D game models.</p>
