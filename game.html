    <h2>Perlin Noise</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>I’ve added an interactive Perlin “Noise explorer” to
                <a href="http://williame.github.io/barebones.js/" target="_blank">barebones.js</a>.</p>
                <p>I had originally used the usual Simplex Noise Javascript port that is in <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/SimplexNoise.js" target="_blank">three.js</a>
                and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>I even ported - successfully - to asm.js!  FWIW, asm.js turned out to be much slower than the
                normal code; this isn’t code that benefits from being ported, it seems; the call overhead is
                quite high.  If you want a lot of noise, e.g. generate a 2D or 3D array in one go, then the asm.js might
                be much faster if the loop is inside asm.js, but as it was - for single samples - it was so much slower
                I abandoned it.</p>
                <p>I didn’t enjoy debugging my port to asm.js and I find all the coercion ugly, but it
                was trivially learnable and may be interesting yet e.g. spatial indices and priority queue heaps.</p>
                <p>But ultimately I wasn’t happy with the tunability of the Simplex Noise
                implementation.  So I instead set about making a very naive reimplementation of Ken Perlin’s
                <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/doc/oscar.html#noise" target="_blank">classic C noise</a>
                in Javascript.</p>
                <p>This lets you set the number of octaves and the alpha and beta values for bumpiness (sometimes
                called persistence).  If you set the scale attribute manually you can even control the scaling of the
                component samples!</p>
                <p>It doubtless runs slower but, for reasonably small chunks of work its more than fast enough. 
                And barebones.js has a cool web-worker wrapper if you want to generate big chunks of noise
                asynchronously.</p>
                <p>I didn’t pay too much attention to GLSL noise - that’s applicable for
                rendering, but not so useful for generating game levels and so on where you really need your noise
                accessible to Javascript (and in webGL you can’t read back framebuffers).</p>
                <p>As a thought-experiment it ought to be possible to do a <a href="http://www.fractalforums.com/general-discussion-b77/distance-estimator-for-perlin-noise/msg64073/#msg64073" target="_blank">distance estimator </a>for Perlin Noise at any threshold.  This would help me
                shadow my visualisation nicely, but it would have rather more general advantages if it sped up making
                big chunks of noise too?</p>

    <h2>Drawing RTS maps fast</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><img alt="image" src="media/old/53831974133_1.jpg"/></p>

                <p><em>Techie bit follows</em>, but first here’s some background:</p>
                <p>At high-school I played the defining Dune 2 RTS game, and then at college I played C&amp;C
                Tiberian Sun.  I poked around (internet was dial-up and slow in those days) and became part of the
                then-thriving game-modding community.  They had reverse-engined the Tiberian Sun model format, but no
                editors existed.  So I made one.  Will’s Voxel Editor, as it was called, was hugely popular in
                the limited world of Tiberian Sun modding.  I worked closely with a modder called Mr War - all modders
                had strange anonymous handles on-line in those days except me - and we made some really cool mods and
                games.</p>

    <h2>WillCity update</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><img alt="image" src="media/old/49797579721_1.jpg"/></p>

                <p><a href="post/49171822294.html" target="_blank">Previously</a>, <a href="post/20163196047.html" target="_blank">previously</a>.</p>
                <p>When run on local-host, the game runs four sims at once, in lock-step.  Three of them are test
                patterns, and the top left is for playing around.</p>
                <p>This makes it very easy to try out and tweak algorithms!</p>
                <p>The top-left layout - residential is red, industrial is pink and commercial blue - is supposed
                to be fairly optimal.  I want the algorithm to favour it, which you can see at the moment it does!</p>
                <p>The bottom left has more space between the zones, and road only on one side.  The algorithm
                should favour growth near the road, and at the moment it does!</p>
                <p>The bottom right is a very sub-optimal layout and I want the algorithm to punish it.
                 Commercial and industrial don’t like each other (although the commercial cares more than the
                industrial).</p>
                <p>The early sims are quite pleasing, but after a while - just a few years since my whole timeline
                thing is not quite set up - things get out of whack and success breeds success and it becomes a run-away
                chain reaction.  I need to think about levelling and damping and so on.</p>
                <p>I’ve been talking to the <a href="http://www.opencity.info/" target="_blank">OpenCity</a>
                devs and the way their algorithm works is:</p>
                <ol><li>each sim step, pick a random residential, commercial or industrial zone to re-score.
                 It doesn’t recompute the scores for all zones each time step.  Change is gradual.</li>
                <li>in a NxN grid, see if there are any of the other two zone types</li>
                <li>depending on the zone type, reward or penalise nearby other zone types</li>
                <li>if the reward is positive, there’s a small chance that the zone will level up</li>
                <li>if the reward is negative, there’s a small chance that the zone will level down</li>
                </ol><p>I have a slightly more computationally-expensive approach, although far from the
                simple balance in OpenCity:</p>
                <ol><li>each sim step, pick between 1 and N% of the RCI zones are re-scored</li>
                <li>for each re-scoring zone,</li>
                <li>perform a best-first search to determine all the other zones within reach</li>
                <li>the transport cost uses one of three transport cost layers - car_and_foot, bus and train.  The
                best-first search can jump between these layers at bus stops and train stations</li>
                <li>at this point I have a list of nearby zones for each type and how far it is away and its score
                and so on; a quite complicated and nuanced algorithm could use all this data.  For now, we do something
                rather simple:</li>
                <li>average the distance*score of each nearby zone type</li>
                <li>if the zone is residential, re-score = commerical_score + industrial_score +
                residential_score*0.1</li>
                <li>if the zone is commercial, re-score = residential_score - industrial_score +
                commercial_score*0.1</li>
                <li>and so on</li>
                <li>then, if the re-score is more than the current score, there’s a 25% probability that
                5% of the difference is added to the zone’s score</li>
                <li>and inverse for re-scoring down</li>
                <li>with some basic clamping</li>
                </ol>

    <h2>Efficient procedural flame particle effects</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>I was playing the other month with making flame particle effects.  Lots of flame
                particle effects:</p>
                <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="256" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Em5gSVgKsBI?rel=0" width="341"> </iframe></p>
                <p>The challenge - in webGL - is to minimise the data transfer per frame.  So I created my flame
                effects procedurally using a random seed.</p>
                <p>I claim no invention nor credit; I based this upon a million Google searches and nothing I’ve
                done is unique; but is novel and fun for me so I share.</p>
                <p>What I did was create a single big VBO of random numbers.  I never updated this list of random
                numbers; I just kept re-using it.  Its an immutable list.  The list is as long as the maximum number of
                particles in any system.</p>
                <p>Then for each particle system I created a unique random number for it.  And a few other things
                like its position and size.</p>
                <p>To draw each system I computed the matrix so that, in its model coordinates, it was always
                drawing inside a -1,-1 -&gt; 1,1 square.   That just simplifies life inside the shaders.</p>
                <p>In vertex shader I use the per-system random number uniform combined with the per-vertex random
                number attribute to seed a random number generator to derive the particle’s attributes e.g.
                size, start-position, direction, colour etc.  I then had a uniform float ‘time’
                passed to determine the frame of animation to draw.</p>
                <p>In this way I could have lots - easily filling the whole screen with tens of thousands - of
                point-sprite-based fire particles and no two systems looked identical!</p>

    <h2>Rendering Spheres with Triangles</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>Creating spheres programmatically has turned up a <a href="http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/?p=1080" target="_blank">couple</a> <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/16585/how-do-you-programmatically-generate-a-sphere" target="_blank">of</a> times recently.  So here are my own notes:</p>
                <p>There are two general approaches:</p>
                <p><img height="94" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kSSSF.png" width="200"/></p>
                <p>The leftmost is termed the <em><strong>uv-sphere</strong></em> and the
                rightmost an <em><strong>icosphere</strong></em>.</p>
                <p>The uv-sphere looks like a globe. For many purposes it is perfectly fine, but for some use
                cases, e.g. if you want to deform the sphere, it is disadvantageous that the density of vertices is
                greater around the poles.  The icosphere vertices are distributed evenly.</p>
                <p>GLUT tends to use the uv approach: look at the function <code>glutSolidSphere()</code>
                in the <a href="http://freeglut.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freeglut/trunk/freeglut/freeglut/src/freeglut_geometry.c?revision=926&amp;view=markup" target="_blank">freeglut sourcecode</a>.</p>
                <p>And <strong>webGL</strong> doesn’t have <code>glutSolidSphere()</code>. 
                Oh well.  <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/4153824" target="_blank">Here’s
                my code for creating an untextured icosphere online</a>.</strong></p>
                <p>Here is an excellent article on producing an icosphere: <a href="http://blog.andreaskahler.com/2009/06/creating-icosphere-mesh-in-code.html" target="_blank">http://blog.andreaskahler.com/2009/06/creating-icosphere-mesh-in-code.html</a></p>
                <p>I’ve also experiemented with tiling spheres for RTS games etc.  Here’s an
                excellent guide to how you might divide the sphere surface into zones: <a href="http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/BUGS/geodesic/text.html" target="_blank">http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/BUGS/geodesic/text.html</a></p>

    <h2>tic-tac-toe</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>My daughters have made a little tic-tac-toe game.  Its a little 3x3 board, played
                with 3 coloured stones each.  You take turns to place stones and try and get 3-in-a-row, as in
                tic-tac-toe.  But when you make your forth move onwards, as you have only three stones, you move a stone…</p>
                <p>And, as I was playing against them, I began to brute-force it in my head…  well, you
                would too!</p>
                <p>Of course I had difficulty stopping thinking about this little game, and ended up seeking
                closure by implementing a <a href="https://gist.github.com/4087469" target="_blank">Python solver</a>
                in my lunch-break.</p>
                <p>It was very clensing coding.  Its nice to return to noddy, pure problems sometimes.  My biggest
                hurdle was making sure I canonicalise the board so that rotations and mirrorings are not mistaken for
                new positions.  I opted for a simple generator that produced all mirrorings and rotations and simply
                checked to see if any of them had been seen before.</p>
                <p>My code run first time!  No typos, and seeming to be doing what I wanted, and from random
                inspection of outputted board positions to next moves, it seemed correct.</p>
                <p>There are 744 boards and 4361 moves.</p>
                <p>But how would you visualise it?  Sounds like a job for graphviz!  It was simplicity itself to
                just change my printouts to print a dot file instead.</p>
                <p>And then dot chewed on it for half an hour and then seg-faulted.</p>
                <p>I tried other graphviz tools (which treat the graph as undirected), but was unhappy with their
                output:</p>
                <p><img height="249" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/orvyk.png" width="314"/></p>
                <p><img height="972" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GJfeQ.png" width="957"/></p>
                <p>I asked for help on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13417411/laying-out-a-large-graph-with-graphviz" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
                <p>And a chap kindly showed me a zoomed-out layout that works:</p>
                <p><img height="1032" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4LJ3.png" width="1250"/></p>
                <p>At that ridiculous zoom, there’s a definite pattern there…</p>
                <p>Only problem is, whilst I can get graphviz to generate that chart, I can’t view it!</p>
                <p>The image is a monster.  PNG 20380x16854, 59.73MB compressed …</p>
                <p>I hit swap as soon as I try and view it in all the image viewers I can find.</p>
                <p>I mulled the problem a bit and imagined simplifying the problem.  You could, for example, start
                pruning pointless moves and those moves that allow the opponent to immediately win and so on.</p>
                <p>But distilling the winning moves seems like a cop-out.  These days, big data shouldn’t
                be scary!</p>
                <p>I considered making my own image-manipulation code.  But that quickly gets into making your own
                layout engine too, and … well, I welcome anyone who can master graphviz and has more RAM than
                I :)</p>

    <h2>Rod-marching on the GPU</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>My <strong><a href="post/26628848007.html" target="_blank">rod-marching</a></strong>
                was an order-of-magnitude faster than classic per-pixel ray-marching on the CPU.</p>
                <p>I have now <a href="http://williame.github.com/Mandel_1" target="_blank">approximated it
                on the GPU</a> - try it <strong>live in your browser</strong> and report back on your
                performance statistics please :)</p>
                <p>First, you render the scene to a small texture, then use this texture as input to the bigger
                scene.</p>
                <p>E.g. you may render a 64x64 texture of the scene using a small number of maximum ray-steps. 
                Then you render to a 256x256 texture using the 64x64 texture as input and another small number of ray
                steps.  And finally you render to the screen with normal ray-steps and the 256x256 texture as input.</p>
                <p>Sadly, the SIMD nature of GPUs works against the big gains seen on the CPU.  Also, the cost of
                changing render targets adds overhead.  On wimpy laptop ATI GPUs I’ve <a href="http://www.fractalforums.com/index.php?topic=12906.0" target="_blank">had speed reports</a>
                of 25 to 50% improvement.  This is not to be sniffed at if it takes you from 10 fps to 15 fps it takes
                you from unplayable to barely tolerable :)</p>
                <p>What is perhaps more interesting is the code I wrote to get webGL going.  I have a nice little
                gluOrtho2D / glOrtho and gluPerspective as well as mat4 inverse function in there for you to copy.</p>

    <h2>OpenGLES I want my GL_QUADS back :(</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>The minimalism of OpenGLES2 is beginning to bug me.  I know too much about mechanical
                sympathy and graphics to completely see eye-to-eye with the architecture astronauts that the companies
                send to Khronos meetings just to get them away from the people who can do real work ;)</p>
                <p>I have two approaches you can take when porting existing, working OpenGL code to OpenGLES2
                whilst trying to have a common-as-possible codebase that targets all the OpenGL flavours:</p>
                <ol><li>Rewrite things to use attribute arrays and OpenGLES2-supported calls and it will
                mostly work on the newer, other OpenGL flavours.  Stuck trying to run the same code on Windows with
                OpenGL 1.1 is not so fun though</li>
                <li>Write a mapping layer</li>
                </ol><p>As it is I started on (2) but have ended up doing (1).  (1) is less effort time-wise
                for me than (2), but if (2) already existed then it would be the clear winner.  Does such a useful
                mapping already exist?</p>
                <p>You could imagine a mapping layer that stored all the glVertex() calls in an array and punched
                out a modern call when you do the glEnd().  And likewise storing all the various client-side state in,
                guess what, client-side variables and so on.  You could imagine it being like GLEW but loading OpenGL
                dynamically at runtime and so exposing classic superset of all supported OpenGL that it then maps to the
                target.</p>
                <p>Myself my code is all VBOs but glVertexPointer etc don’t exist on OpenGLES2.  And
                they don’t seem to have anything like hand-holding of interleaving arrays, meaning when I
                interleave my arrays myself.</p>
                <p>Oh the pain!</p>
                <p>Its like they don’t want to have any sensible migration path for existing code.  They
                put so many small barriers to cheap migrating that in the end it adds up to a massive hurdle.  Its about
                as much hassle to move to OpenGLES2 as to move to DirectX11 instead.</p>
                <p>Of all the things missing in OpenGLES2 its GL_QUADS that irritates and inconveniences me most. 
                All my font glyths and particle effects and some game tiles are GL_QUADS and I can’t think of
                a good reason for not supporting them.  It really grates to be duplicating a couple of vertices for each
                quad when targeting precisely the most memory-constrained target.  I guess in the end its no big deal,
                but it just feels wrong.</p>
                <p>Its all too easy to imagine the architecture astronauts sitting around a table saying ‘well
                you can make a quad from two triangles, and sometimes if they aren’t on a plane you want to
                control the fold anyway, so lets get rid of yet another primitive!’.  I guess I’m
                bitter and cynical about design-by-committee.</p>
                <p>What possible justification can there be for not having GL_QUADS?  If there’s some
                mechanical antipathy, I want it explained!</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>When playing with game engine ideas, I struggled with the fact that my laptops all
                had very very bad integrated chips by Intel.  Yeap, those ones.</p>
                <p>I wanted a nice cartoony fluffy clouds and bobbly trees, but all those spheres were taking just
                too many polygons.</p>
                <p>The solution I prototyped was to bill-board spheres… complete with depth.</p>
                <p>The billboard image was actually a depth-map.  I was using a special value to indicate no texel
                and do a discard in the fragment shader.</p>
                <p>To get nice edges on the spheres I did it in two passes; first pass, draw all opaque texels
                inside the circle of the billboard, setting depth; second pass, draw all semi-transparent texels on the
                edges of the spheres without setting depth (i.e. its at billboard depth).</p>
                <p>I found that I could draw almost a thousand such spheres at a good enough framerate on the
                worst cards.  On more average ATI and NVidia cards the framerate was nicely in the hundreds.  So this is
                a very efficient technique.</p>
                <p>Shadows can be done by sampling the depth buffer in a second pass and using a 1D texture that
                is the cross-section of the sphere.  I didn’t prototype that bit; its an exercise for the
                dedicated reader ;)</p>
