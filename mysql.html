</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>Here’s a horrid hack or neat trick to work around a gaping inefficiency in the MySQL
                query planner:</p><p>Imagine you have a very large table and a composite index e.g. the
                fields <i><b>A</b></i>, <i><b>B</b></i>, <i><b>C</b></i>
                and <i><b>D</b></i>.</p><p>Imagine you have a query WHERE <b><i>A</i>
                = ?</b> AND <b><i>C</i> = ?</b></p><p>MySQL will use the index
                to check all the values of <b><i>A</i></b> but dereference each row with the
                matching <b><i>A</i></b> before checking the <b><i>C</i></b>.</p><p>You
                can see what is happening using EXPLAIN SELECT by looking at the KEY and KEY_LEN columns: the index will
                be named the KEY (good so far!) and the KEY_LEN will be the max size of column <b><i>A</i></b>
                (ugh!). </p><p>If you supply a dummy clause constraining <b><i>B</i></b>
                too then you can force MySQL to check the <b><i>C</i></b> constraint before it
                dereferences any rows: SELECT … WHERE <b><i>A</i> = ?</b> AND <b><i>B</i>
                != ?</b> AND <b><i>C</i> = ?</b> (where <b><i>B</i></b>
                can be checked against some value that it can’t possibly be).</p><p>You can confirm this is
                happening by looking that the EXPLAIN SELECT again: the KEY will still be the name of the index (if it
                isn’t, you can force the index to be used with a USE INDEX clause) and the KEY_LEN will now be the
                maximum length of the <b><i>A</i></b>, <b><i>B</i></b>
                and <b><i>C</i></b> fields combined.</p><p>You can even use this
                trick to get an index used even if the very first field in the composite index is not constrained, e.g.
                WHERE <b><i>A</i> != ?</b> AND <b><i>B</i> = ?</b></p><p>This
                isn’t foolproof - you always need to benchmark with your database!  Using any index and the additional
                dereference cost compared to just doing a table scan in the first place assumes that the index is
                dramatically cheaper to walk and will dramatically reduce the number of rows that need to be
                dereferenced.  If only a tiny subset of the table needs to be dereferenced, the index will help; if a
                large proportion of the table is going to be dereferenced anyway then it’d be better to do a table scan
                from the get-go.</p><p><i>However</i>, if you have very large tables and you
                have composite keys that cover your fields but which some of the composite keys unconstrained then its
                well worth evaluating this approach which, in the right circumstances, can give orders of magnitude
                improvements.</p><p>Why doesn’t MySQL use this trick internally?  Well, it should!  If its
                already decided to use a composite ordered index for some prefix of the constrained fields, then it
                should always check all constraints it can before dereferencing any actual rows. If MySQL used this
                trick you wouldn’t have to find some impossible value to fake a check against either.</p><p>Its
                a bit harder to say if it can work out when to use a composite index when there is no prefix at all. 
                And of course it doesn’t work with hash indices.</p><p>Does MariaDB use this trick
                internally automatically?  I don’t know but I doubt it.</p><p>Does PostgreSQL?  No idea. 
                Etc.</p><p><i>If you liked this</i> you might like my recent stats on <a href="post/160628887798.html">database

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><i>TL;DR: use TokuDB.  Always.  It massively reduces storage requirements and
                is massively faster than InnoDB, even on low end hardware.  My tables were compressed to just <b>12%</b>
                original size and that’s fairly typical.</i></p><p>A very simple structure:<br/></p><pre>CREATE
                TABLE test (<br/>      date DATE NOT NULL,<br/>      site VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,<br/>  
                   order_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,<br/>      time TIME NOT NULL,<br/>      kind ENUM(...) NOT
                NULL,<br/>      account INTEGER,<br/>      user INTEGER,<br/>      client_price
                BIGINT,<br/>      supplier_id INTEGER,<br/>      supplier_cost BIGINT,<br/>    
                 client_ref VARCHAR(32),<br/>      data JSON,<br/>      PRIMARY KEY (date, site, order_id),<br/>
                     INDEX (account, user, client_ref)
                ) DEFAULT CHARSET utf8<br/>PARTITION BY RANGE (TO_DAYS(date)) ( ...<br/></pre><p>This
                system is using the RDBMS as a document store; the order items are being flattened into a document store
                (the ‘data’ field).</p><p>The ETL is upserting order events as they are processed, using
                multi-row INSERT INTO … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE …</p><p>And I’ve been
                running performance tests with some real data.  27M rows of real data, all on the same day (so all in
                the same partition).  37M upsert statements inserting or updating those 27M rows, issued in batches of
                1K-2K per multi-row statement.  This is enough rows to be able to get a grasp of upsert performance and
                extrapolate storage requirements.</p><p>The test box is an AWS t2.medium instance.  This is
                a very weak VM with 2 (virtual) CPUs and 4GB RAM.  Not normal DB fare, so performance beware.</p><p>The
                27M rows take 10.48GB uncompressed.  It takes InnoDB 10 hours to load all the data.</p><!--
                more --><p>In the old days, MySQL InnoDB offered ‘row_compression’.  This compresses individual
                rows.  This reduces disk requirements to 5.73GB (<b>45% space saved</b>).  So it halves the
                disk space!  Sadly, the test now took 15 hours instead of 10 hours.</p><p>More recently,
                MySQL introduced ‘table compression’.  (MariaDB also added it, calling it ‘page compression’; the CREATE
                TABLE syntax is infuriatingly slightly different).</p><p>Underneath, InnoDB is organized
                as ‘pages’.  This table compression intercepts these page reads and writes and, as pages are written to
                disk, they are individually compressed and written as a ‘sparse’ file.</p><p>As these InnoDB
                pages are larger than the file system pages, there is the opportunity for a ‘hole’ to be ‘punched’ in
                each InnoDB page.  Imagine an InnoDB page is 12KB, and the file system page size is 4KB.  The page may
                compress down to 1KB, meaning it only needs the first file system page (4KB),  and 8KB would be saved.
                 This example illustrates how wasteful this approach can be; there can still be a lot of slack in each
                page.  The total file-size as reported by ls is unchanged, but the actual used disk space (as shown by
                e.g. ls -s) is reduced.  Page compression compresses this table to 4.07GB (<b>61% savings</b>).
                 The bad news is that performance sinks awfully!  I aborted the run after 32 hours, as upsert speed had
                dropped to under 100 orders/sec.  I’ve seen this on MariaDB RDS and on my little t2.medium.  Its
                atrocious!</p><p><b><i>TokuDB is an alternative storage engine to InnoDB</i></b>.
                 It is nicely packaged by Percona so its very straightforward to install.</p><p>TokuDB
                compresses databases with zlib by default.  It compresses pages, but doesn’t store them as sparse files;
                instead, the total file size you see on disk is the total file size.</p><p>TokuDB with zlib
                compresses to <b>1.45GB (86% savings)</b>!  This is the same compression algorithm as InnoDB
                page compression and operating at much the same logical page level, but conferring much bigger savings
                because each ‘page’ is not rounded up to a multiple of the file system page size.</p><p>Because
                InnoDB puts the whole table (or, as in this case, partition) into a single file you cannot see how much
                of the storage is for the primary rows and how much is for secondary indexes.  TokuDB, however, has
                separate files for each index.  So in this case there are two files for the partition, and I can see
                that the 27M rows takes 1.02GB and the by-client index takes 0.44GB.</p><p>TokuDB allows you
                to specify other compression algorithms.  The weakest (thus fastest) is ‘snappy’, which is an LZ77
                compressor without entropy coding.  It compresses to 2.31GB (78% savings; same ratio rows to index).</p><p>There
                is also QuickLZ (between snappy and zlib in CPU requirements; 1.95GB; 81% savings) and LZMA (stronger
                than zlib; <b>1.23GB; 88% savings!</b>).</p><p>LZMA is a clear winner here.
                 What’s fascinating about the TokuDB though is not just its space-saving but also its performance: it
                takes<b> just 2 hours</b> to run my ETL and choice of compression algorithm has no
                noticeable effect on that!</p><p>Now the dire uncompressed InnoDB performance is perhaps the
                classic “InnoDB is not good with databases that don’t fit into RAM”.  I was using Percona packages so
                the defaults were not as mad as they used to be out-of-the-box with other linux sources, but I did up it
                to 2GB and a big log.  Configuring InnoDB optimally is like reading tea leaves and no amount of doing it
                makes me confident I’ve hit the sweat spot for any particular workload.  This upsert workload seems to
                be particularly stressful.  The t2.medium has two (virtual) CPUs, and as upsert performance dropped I
                saw ‘top’ reporting load average over 2.0 even though ETL was waiting on the DB.  Not good.</p><p>However
                the dire compressed InnoDB performance I saw repeated on a MariaDB RDS m4.2xlarge with the same
                data-set.  There’s something wrong with either InnoDB page compression, or with EBS spare file
                performance!</p><p>On the other hand, TokuDB shows how to do things properly!  The
                out-of-the-box defaults are very sane (it doesn’t use O_DIRECT; instead, it takes 50% to store
                uncompressed pages, and lets the OS cache the compressed pages in the normal file buffer cache.
                 Inspired!).  And the performance is just so stable!  On the t2.medium, which is a piddling little box,
                I saw 5000 orders/sec sustained throughout the entire run.</p><p>I think I’ve heard that
                TokuDB is marginally slower than (uncompressed) InnoDB on small tables.  And perhaps most users have
                small tables.  I don’t think there’s actually that measurable a gap when everything is tiny.  But the
                moment you go over a million rows or contemplate partitioning then I think TokuDB is the obvious choice.
                 In fact it would make a very good default.</p><p>Oh, and for kicks, try a COUNT(*) on a big
                InnoDB table.  And then go make a coffee!  TokuDB … snap!  Not based on meta-data like MyIASM
                did neither; just so much faster.</p><p>TokuDB redefines what a ‘small’ database is.  It
                moves the goalposts.  It means I can build bigger systems without scaling sideways.  I don’t get why
                everyone still uses InnoDB ;)</p>
