    <h2>Faster searches with non-prefix fields in composite indices</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>Here’s a horrid hack or neat trick to work around a gaping inefficiency in the MySQL
                query planner:</p><p>Imagine you have a very large table and a composite index e.g. the
                fields <i><b>A</b></i>, <i><b>B</b></i>, <i><b>C</b></i>
                and <i><b>D</b></i>.</p><p>Imagine you have a query WHERE <b><i>A</i>
                = ?</b> AND <b><i>C</i> = ?</b></p><p>MySQL will use the index
                to check all the values of <b><i>A</i></b> but dereference each row with the
                matching <b><i>A</i></b> before checking the <b><i>C</i></b>.</p><p>You
                can see what is happening using EXPLAIN SELECT by looking at the KEY and KEY_LEN columns: the index will
                be named the KEY (good so far!) and the KEY_LEN will be the max size of column <b><i>A</i></b>
                (ugh!). </p><p>If you supply a dummy clause constraining <b><i>B</i></b>
                too then you can force MySQL to check the <b><i>C</i></b> constraint before it
                dereferences any rows: SELECT … WHERE <b><i>A</i> = ?</b> AND <b><i>B</i>
                != ?</b> AND <b><i>C</i> = ?</b> (where <b><i>B</i></b>
                can be checked against some value that it can’t possibly be).</p><p>You can confirm this is
                happening by looking that the EXPLAIN SELECT again: the KEY will still be the name of the index (if it
                isn’t, you can force the index to be used with a USE INDEX clause) and the KEY_LEN will now be the
                maximum length of the <b><i>A</i></b>, <b><i>B</i></b>
                and <b><i>C</i></b> fields combined.</p><p>You can even use this
                trick to get an index used even if the very first field in the composite index is not constrained, e.g.
                WHERE <b><i>A</i> != ?</b> AND <b><i>B</i> = ?</b></p><p>This
                isn’t foolproof - you always need to benchmark with your database!  Using any index and the additional
                dereference cost compared to just doing a table scan in the first place assumes that the index is
                dramatically cheaper to walk and will dramatically reduce the number of rows that need to be
                dereferenced.  If only a tiny subset of the table needs to be dereferenced, the index will help; if a
                large proportion of the table is going to be dereferenced anyway then it’d be better to do a table scan
                from the get-go.</p><p><i>However</i>, if you have very large tables and you
                have composite keys that cover your fields but which some of the composite keys unconstrained then its
                well worth evaluating this approach which, in the right circumstances, can give orders of magnitude
                improvements.</p><p>Why doesn’t MySQL use this trick internally?  Well, it should!  If its
                already decided to use a composite ordered index for some prefix of the constrained fields, then it
                should always check all constraints it can before dereferencing any actual rows. If MySQL used this
                trick you wouldn’t have to find some impossible value to fake a check against either.</p><p>Its
                a bit harder to say if it can work out when to use a composite index when there is no prefix at all. 
                And of course it doesn’t work with hash indices.</p><p>Does MariaDB use this trick
                internally automatically?  I don’t know but I doubt it.</p><p>Does PostgreSQL?  No idea. 
                Etc.</p><p><i>If you liked this</i> you might like my recent stats on <a href="post/160628887798.html">database

    <h2>Compressing MySQL databases</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><i>TL;DR: use TokuDB.  Always.  It massively reduces storage requirements and
                is massively faster than InnoDB, even on low end hardware.  My tables were compressed to just <b>12%</b>
                original size and that’s fairly typical.</i></p><p>A very simple structure:<br/></p><pre>CREATE
                TABLE test (<br/>      date DATE NOT NULL,<br/>      site VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,<br/>  
                   order_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,<br/>      time TIME NOT NULL,<br/>      kind ENUM(...) NOT
                NULL,<br/>      account INTEGER,<br/>      user INTEGER,<br/>      client_price
                BIGINT,<br/>      supplier_id INTEGER,<br/>      supplier_cost BIGINT,<br/>    
                 client_ref VARCHAR(32),<br/>      data JSON,<br/>      PRIMARY KEY (date, site, order_id),<br/>
                     INDEX (account, user, client_ref)
                ) DEFAULT CHARSET utf8<br/>PARTITION BY RANGE (TO_DAYS(date)) ( ...<br/></pre><p>This
                system is using the RDBMS as a document store; the order items are being flattened into a document store
                (the ‘data’ field).</p><p>The ETL is upserting order events as they are processed, using
                multi-row INSERT INTO … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE …</p><p>And I’ve been
                running performance tests with some real data.  27M rows of real data, all on the same day (so all in
                the same partition).  37M upsert statements inserting or updating those 27M rows, issued in batches of
                1K-2K per multi-row statement.  This is enough rows to be able to get a grasp of upsert performance and
                extrapolate storage requirements.</p><p>The test box is an AWS t2.medium instance.  This is
                a very weak VM with 2 (virtual) CPUs and 4GB RAM.  Not normal DB fare, so performance beware.</p><p>The
                27M rows take 10.48GB uncompressed.  It takes InnoDB 10 hours to load all the data.</p><!--
                more --><p>In the old days, MySQL InnoDB offered ‘row_compression’.  This compresses individual
                rows.  This reduces disk requirements to 5.73GB (<b>45% space saved</b>).  So it halves the
                disk space!  Sadly, the test now took 15 hours instead of 10 hours.</p><p>More recently,
                MySQL introduced ‘table compression’.  (MariaDB also added it, calling it ‘page compression’; the CREATE
                TABLE syntax is infuriatingly slightly different).</p><p>Underneath, InnoDB is organized
                as ‘pages’.  This table compression intercepts these page reads and writes and, as pages are written to
                disk, they are individually compressed and written as a ‘sparse’ file.</p><p>As these InnoDB
                pages are larger than the file system pages, there is the opportunity for a ‘hole’ to be ‘punched’ in
                each InnoDB page.  Imagine an InnoDB page is 12KB, and the file system page size is 4KB.  The page may
                compress down to 1KB, meaning it only needs the first file system page (4KB),  and 8KB would be saved.
                 This example illustrates how wasteful this approach can be; there can still be a lot of slack in each
                page.  The total file-size as reported by ls is unchanged, but the actual used disk space (as shown by
                e.g. ls -s) is reduced.  Page compression compresses this table to 4.07GB (<b>61% savings</b>).
                 The bad news is that performance sinks awfully!  I aborted the run after 32 hours, as upsert speed had
                dropped to under 100 orders/sec.  I’ve seen this on MariaDB RDS and on my little t2.medium.  Its
                atrocious!</p><p><b><i>TokuDB is an alternative storage engine to InnoDB</i></b>.
                 It is nicely packaged by Percona so its very straightforward to install.</p><p>TokuDB
                compresses databases with zlib by default.  It compresses pages, but doesn’t store them as sparse files;
                instead, the total file size you see on disk is the total file size.</p><p>TokuDB with zlib
                compresses to <b>1.45GB (86% savings)</b>!  This is the same compression algorithm as InnoDB
                page compression and operating at much the same logical page level, but conferring much bigger savings
                because each ‘page’ is not rounded up to a multiple of the file system page size.</p><p>Because
                InnoDB puts the whole table (or, as in this case, partition) into a single file you cannot see how much
                of the storage is for the primary rows and how much is for secondary indexes.  TokuDB, however, has
                separate files for each index.  So in this case there are two files for the partition, and I can see
                that the 27M rows takes 1.02GB and the by-client index takes 0.44GB.</p><p>TokuDB allows you
                to specify other compression algorithms.  The weakest (thus fastest) is ‘snappy’, which is an LZ77
                compressor without entropy coding.  It compresses to 2.31GB (78% savings; same ratio rows to index).</p><p>There
                is also QuickLZ (between snappy and zlib in CPU requirements; 1.95GB; 81% savings) and LZMA (stronger
                than zlib; <b>1.23GB; 88% savings!</b>).</p><p>LZMA is a clear winner here.
                 What’s fascinating about the TokuDB though is not just its space-saving but also its performance: it
                takes<b> just 2 hours</b> to run my ETL and choice of compression algorithm has no
                noticeable effect on that!</p><p>Now the dire uncompressed InnoDB performance is perhaps the
                classic “InnoDB is not good with databases that don’t fit into RAM”.  I was using Percona packages so
                the defaults were not as mad as they used to be out-of-the-box with other linux sources, but I did up it
                to 2GB and a big log.  Configuring InnoDB optimally is like reading tea leaves and no amount of doing it
                makes me confident I’ve hit the sweat spot for any particular workload.  This upsert workload seems to
                be particularly stressful.  The t2.medium has two (virtual) CPUs, and as upsert performance dropped I
                saw ‘top’ reporting load average over 2.0 even though ETL was waiting on the DB.  Not good.</p><p>However
                the dire compressed InnoDB performance I saw repeated on a MariaDB RDS m4.2xlarge with the same
                data-set.  There’s something wrong with either InnoDB page compression, or with EBS spare file
                performance!</p><p>On the other hand, TokuDB shows how to do things properly!  The
                out-of-the-box defaults are very sane (it doesn’t use O_DIRECT; instead, it takes 50% to store
                uncompressed pages, and lets the OS cache the compressed pages in the normal file buffer cache.
                 Inspired!).  And the performance is just so stable!  On the t2.medium, which is a piddling little box,
                I saw 5000 orders/sec sustained throughout the entire run.</p><p>I think I’ve heard that
                TokuDB is marginally slower than (uncompressed) InnoDB on small tables.  And perhaps most users have
                small tables.  I don’t think there’s actually that measurable a gap when everything is tiny.  But the
                moment you go over a million rows or contemplate partitioning then I think TokuDB is the obvious choice.
                 In fact it would make a very good default.</p><p>Oh, and for kicks, try a COUNT(*) on a big
                InnoDB table.  And then go make a coffee!  TokuDB … snap!  Not based on meta-data like MyIASM
                did neither; just so much faster.</p><p>TokuDB redefines what a ‘small’ database is.  It
                moves the goalposts.  It means I can build bigger systems without scaling sideways.  I don’t get why
                everyone still uses InnoDB ;)</p>

                </ul><p>My favourite book was <a href="https://simonsingh.net/books/fermats-last-theorem/">Fermat’s
                Last Theorem</a> by Simon Singh.  So when in 1999 I saw his new book - <a href="https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/">The Code Book</a> - in shops I just had to
                buy it, despite it being incredibly expensive (for a very poor student like myself).  I then took my new
                prize procession with me expectantly on the summer holiday.  And when I reached the end of the book that
                I discovered it contained a <a href="https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/the-ciphertexts/">Cipher Challenge</a>!</p><p>I
                set about cracking the ciphers with gusto.  By chance I happened to have my 286 computer with me, and my
                hobby language of choice - Turbo Pascal 7. </p><p>I think I skipped the ADFGVX cipher, so
                excited was I at the prospect of cracking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma</a>
                stage 8 of the contest.  Unfortunately, when I reached the Enigma, I was stumped.  I couldn’t
                make any headway with simulating the Enigma.  I wrongly assumed that the message would begin with the
                message key encrypted with the day key twice.  But my biggest mistake was not understanding how rings
                affected things.  I didn’t understand how rings affected things because The Code Book didn’t
                actually explain them!  The book instructed the intrepid explorer to search the Internet for more
                details and I didn’t take any heed of this because a) I couldn’t imagine the book
                wouldn’t actually give me everything I needed to crack the challenge, and b) I didn’t
                have any Internet.  The Enigma I was trying to crack wasn’t even an accurate Enigma.</p><p>So
                17 years later I find myself on a whim tacking the Enigma once again.  And my computer is a bit faster
                too.  But I want to attack it my way, putting myself as much as possible in the shoes of my old self 17
                years ago, only this time with Internet so I can double-check the correctness and completeness of my
                implementation of the Engima cipher machine.</p><p>This is my attack on the Enigma.  I will
                describe my attack on an M3 Enigma (used by the army and air force) and then I will generalize it to
                attack the M4 (used by the U-boats; what Alan Turing is famous for cracking).</p><!-- more --></post-body>

                <p>The settings for each rotor - its start position and ring setting - can actually be combined
                into a single offset. This is perhaps why all the popular treatments of the subject just ignore the
                impact of the rings on the number of combinations. In truth, their impact is hard to explain. The rings
                change when rotors rotate, and do have an impact on the number of combinations, but many initial
                starting positions are equivilent for short messages because the rings cancel out the rotor start
                position and do not cause a rotation because the message is too short.</p>

                <p>The M4 Enigma - as infamously used by the U-boats - is usually described as a ‘four
                rotor’ machine. And that’s strictly true, I suppose, but I think I have a better way
                of describing it:</p>

                <p>The M4 was a normal 3-rotor M3 Enigma chassis. A new 'thin’ reflector design was
                developed that could take a new, thinner 'greek’ non-rotating wheel. The thin greek wheel
                could be placed in any of 26 positions and clicked into the thin reflector. This could then be placed in
                the chassis in the normal reflector position.</p>

                <p>So basically the M4 is an M3 Enigma with a configurable reflector.</p>

                <p>I wrote the fast Enigma sim to serve as a basis of a statistical attack on the Enigma. In fact,
                if you look at my test vectors, you’ll notice one of them is <a href="https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/" target="_blank">Simon Singh’s
                Cipher Challenge Enigma stage 8</a>, which I cracked using my statistical attack! More on that in
                the next post :)</p>

                <p>And here’s the code. As you can see, the vast majority of the code is just test
                vectors to ensure its correctness:</p>

                <p>It turns out my kids have been sending each other secret messages, enciphered with a
                substitution cipher of their own invention!  They only let me see the secret key when I agreed to help
                them mix up a very complicated recipe for invisible ink:</p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="640" data-orig-width="480" src="media/old/145304200648_1.jpg"/><p>This reawakened
                fond memories of a young me getting a good way through Simon Singh’s The Code Book <a href="https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/">cipher challenge</a> :)  (Also, see
                the <a href="post/19946053957.html">Enigma
                Spreadsheet</a> my friend made a few years ago!)</p><p>So my mind raced considering
                how fast todays laptops can brute-force, say, Enigma?  Even non-brute-force attacks are on a different
                scale if you have a computer.  For example, with Enigma, can you ignore the plugboard and go through
                every combination of day and message key, using a histogram to spot possible text that you then attack
                as a substitution cipher?</p><p>First I needed an accurate Enigma simulator.  To be honest,
                I found most descriptions a bit light on detail.  But I quickly found a <a href="http://wiki.franklinheath.co.uk/index.php/Enigma/Paper_Enigma">paper Enigma</a>, which I

    <h2>Why Swift?</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>The programming blogosphere is chock full of hype with Apple open-sourcing their
                Swift language.</p><p>So is this exciting?  No, not really.  I can’t see what all the hype
                is about.</p><p>Swift is very much tied to Apple’s walled-garden of iOS app development.
                 Anyone developing for iPhone has to pick between anarchic Objective C and new shiny Swift.  Its a
                captive audience.  Its an audience unaffected by whether Swift is open-source or not.</p><p>Will
                Swift be used for anything else any time soon?  I think not.</p><p>If you’re developing for
                the server, are you going to adopt Swift?  For me, the fact that IBM is backing server-side Swift is all
                the death knell you need ;)</p><p>If you’re developing for the server you already have a
                myriad of languages to pick from.  From scripting languages like Ruby, Python and Javascript, to
                compiled languages like Java, C/C++ and Go, you have a full range.  If you want a ‘safer’ language you
                can go Haskell or Rust.  What is so compelling about adopting Swift on the server-side?   I can’t spot
                anything at all.</p><p>Swift on the server is going to be about as popular as C#.  Its a
                language you use if key parts of your project on other platforms are forced to use it.</p><p>I
                like how Swift reasons about integer overflow and nil.  I wish there was a ‘safe’ C.  But that’s not
                making me itching to go use Swift for server-side programming.</p>

    <h2>SSIM vs MSE for Mosaics</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><img data-orig-height="125" data-orig-width="600" src="media/old/117234199303_1.jpg"/><p>(On the left, a target image.
                 On the right, a <a alt="dead link: http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/04/22/i-made-a-list-of-games-you-should-play/" href="/#404">mosaic made from
                thumbnails of all the Ludum Dare 32 games</a>, positioned using an MSE score metric.)</p><p>Making
                mosaics is in two steps:</p><ol><li>score each tile in each position</li><li>determine
                the optimal positioning of all tiles to maximize the total likeness</li></ol><p>The
                second part is easy (although I tried imprecise approximations at first, and only discovered it fairly
                recently): use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian Algorithm</a>.</p><p>Its
                that first step that’s tricky.</p><p>I have been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">Mean Square Error (MSE)</a> and have
                been fairly happy with the result.  But readers have pondered if there aren’t better metrics that better
                account for shape and contrast and such…</p><p>So to please some Ludum Darers
                (and because I was curious), I tried out some algorithms.</p><p>First, <a alt="dead link: http://Peak%20signal-to-noise%20ratio" href="/#404">Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)</a> is just a
                rephrasing of MSE and the results are much the same.</p><p>Second, I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity">Structural Similarity (SSIM) index</a>.
                 This was a promising avenue to explore.  My mosaic maker is Python and there’s a scikit helper, but
                scikit doesn’t work with pypy (and neither does a stock numpy; trying to get the mosaic maker to work
                happily in pypy with these kinds of dependencies has been a nightmare).  In the end I went with pyssim
                which turned out to not work in pypy either due to dependencies but I stuck with it on cpython anyway.
                 Its about 4x slower than MSE and most of the cost seems to be comparison overhead and not really
                affected by how big the patches I compared were.</p><p>SSIM is actually working in luma (eh
                fancy term for grayscale) and trying to account for shape not colour.</p><p>The results:</p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="387" src="media/old/117234199303_2.jpg"/><p>(On the left, the
                original.  In the middle, MSE.  And on the right, SSIM.  Tiles are the thumbnails of <b><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/">2819 Ludum Dare 32 games</a></b>
                (omitting 2 games with broken thumbnails!))</p><p>So I tried blending the MSE and SSIM
                scores (suitably scaled of course) but couldn’t get even a little bit of SSIM to help:</p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="137" src="media/old/117234199303_3.jpg"/><p>(Here 70% MSE and
                30% SSIM.  I even tried 8% SSIM and it looked much the same.)</p><p>I also tested using the
                YCbCr colour-space too; results were much the same (as all the tiles are screenshots they are invariably
                natively RGB; if the tiles were made from photos there’s a good chance that YUV makes much more sense).</p><p>Now
                I am making a novice interpretation of this but my guess is that in mosaics, which are best viewed from
                a great distance where the tiles are increasingly pixel-sized, tile colour dominates over shapes within
                the tile?</p>

    <h2>Connecting Ludum Dare to the Real World</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> is
                a really popular game making contest.  Three or so times a year several thousand competitors all over
                the world wait for the theme to be announced and the contest to start!</p>
                <p>Last weekend was the 30th contest (LD30) and the theme was “Connected Worlds”.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/08/16/ludum-dare-30-theme-voting-begins/" target="_blank">voting</a> wasn’t even close, which is a shame as I was very lukewarm
                to the theme.  I feared there’d be lots of platform games where you run two levels in
                parallel, or can swap between levels, etc.</p>
                <p>And that’s what 90% of games are, sadly.  I don’t mean they are bad games -
                many of them are really exceptionally good! - I just mean the theme lent itself to a very literal
                interpretation.</p>
                <p>My interpretation was to try and connect Ludum Darers to the <em>real</em> world
                instead :)</p>
                <p>I recalled that hidden away on the LD website was a map where LDers could record their position
                on a map.  It was not terribly well known, but there were several hundred player’s latitude
                and longitude in there.  It was enough to make sure that any map wasn’t completely empty for
                the first player…</p>
                <p>So I made a ‘game’ where you report your position, and then see other
                contestants near you and can browse LD games on the real world map.</p>
                <p>The game aspect is the gamification of rating LD games.  In order to discover the overall LD
                winner, contestants play each other’s games and rate them.  They have 3 weeks to do this, and
                then the standings are announced.  And I wanted to encourage that participation, as there’s
                really games that go unplayed and contestants that don’t play.</p>
                <p>I scrape the LD website and, as a proxy for rating others games, I note who has commented on
                whom.  As well as rating games you can comment on games, and whilst these are distinct they are often
                done together.</p>
                <p>So I draw the map with line art, and use a GL stencil buffer to expose an underlying map where
                you’ve commented on games or others have commented on your game:</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&amp;uid=10313"><img alt="image" data-orig-height="223" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/95981048318_1.png"/></a></p>

                it online here!</a></strong>  If you’re not an LD player, you can <em>pretend</em>
                to be!</p>
                <p>The map that you expose is illustrated by me and the usual suspect, who goes by the handle <a href="post/30793134312.html" target="_blank">Wombatica</a> on the LD site.</p>
                <p>I’ve been overwelmed by the popular appeal and compliments!  I hadn’t
                expected to get so many appreciative LDers!  I’ve been rated over 150 times already, which is
                many times the ratings I’ve received on previous contests.  People keep coming back, and
                people keep checking progress.</p>

                are saying</a> the nicest things too!  Here’s some of the over-the-top ones :)</p>

                <li>Now the fourth wall have been shattered.  thank you.</li>
                <li>Will - really, really good job… This should win I think, just for the sheer cheek
                of subverting the idea and pointing LD at itself, can see this becoming a favourite interface for LD in
                the future… very great !</li>
                <li>You made playing games a game, that’s a 5 stars on innovation, no doubt. Also,
                connecting the LD world with the real world… Another 5 stars for theme!</li>
                <li>Man. This is SO neat! This game wins like all of the LDs. Amazing job!</li>
                <li>I gave you an award on your profile for this game.</li>

    <h2>Python annotations and type checking</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2014-August/028618.html">Someone
                got at Guido</a>!  He comes back from some talk with the idea of blessing <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> type checking annotations in Python!</p><p>Now
                those following along may recall my own type-checking library <b><a href="post/33185451698.html">obiwan</a></b>
                that also uses annotations.  Its on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obiwan">pypi</a>
                so you can use it already today!  What are you waiting for?</p>
                <p>I’m keen on static checkers, although I prefer static type <i>inference</i>
                and have ideas along those lines such as <a href="post/15203221199.html">Static Single
                Type Assignment</a> (SSTA).</p>
                <p>Fundamentally, though, restricted Python isn’t Python.  We want a dynamic language,
                and this hits on the limits of static checking.  Obiwan’s runtime checking is a compliment to
                a static checker and its ability to check external data e.g. tainted JSON input from an API is a major
                plus too.</p>
                <p>What we want is for static checkers, auto-completion in IDEs and runtime checkers like obiwan
                to <i>all use the same syntax and conventions.</i></p>
                <p><i>But</i> I don’t like the mypy syntax; its baroque and it even
                overloads comments (yuck!).  I much prefer obiwan’s style and would like annotations to be
                supported in-block as well as on the boundaries i.e. declarations.</p>
                <p>Consider this mypy example:</p>
                <pre> from typing import List, Dict

                def word_count(input: List[str]) -&gt; Dict[str, int]:
                ...
                </pre>
                <p>Obiwan would instead say:</p>
                <pre> def word_count(input: [str]) -&gt; {str: int}:
                ...
                </pre>
                <p>Which I consider far <i>clearer</i> and pythonic.</p>
                <p><a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2014-August/028684.html">My reply
                to the list is here</a>.</p>
                <p>FWIW, I don’t imagine anything will come from this.  There is unlikely to be
                consensus, and although I’d like a solid PEP that puts annotations into blocks it would so
                risk slowing down programs that I think it unlikely to be adopted.  So we may be left with a clear
                message that people are to use mypy or whatever, but no actual solid move forwards.</p>

    <h2>Compressing Scrabble Dictionaries</h2>
</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>The newest r<a href="http://www.azspcs.net/" target="_blank">ec.math Al
                Zimmermann Programming Contest</a> is a solitaire Scrabble puzzle called ’<a href="http://www.azspcs.net/Contest/AlphabetCity" target="_blank">Alphabet City</a>’.</p>
                <p>Wait, what do you mean you’re not entering that programming contest??  Its a really
                really nice clean problem and it’s addictive as 2048!</p>
                <p>To lookup scrabble words quickly, people use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GADDAG" target="_blank">GADDAG</a>.  The GADDAG is a tree data-structure.  Each node represents a
                character, and has pointers to all the child nodes that continue all possible words.</p>
                <p>The key thing is that every rotation of each word is stored in the GADDAG.  To have a GADDAG of
                the words ALL, BALL and CALL, for each word we add all rotations.  This is LLA@, LA@L, A@LL for <em>ALL</em>,
                and LLAB@, LAB@L, AB@LL, B@ALL for <em>BALL</em> and so on.  (@ is my choice of ‘start-of-word’
                marker; its a good choice because in ASCII its the character before A.  When you have arrays of child
                nodes [A..Z], this can easily be extended to have a slot pointing at the start-of-word node [@..Z].  And
                it looks nice enough in the graphs too.)</p>
                <p>To speed up Scrabble searches, the prefix of each word is stored <em>reversed</em>
                which facilitates 'hook’ searches.  To search for all words with one letter then A then
                another empty then L (?A?L), you start with the first known letter - A - and look for all those with one
                character in front (a child with a @ child), terminated by an L.</p>
                <p>A naive sparse implementation of a GADDAG takes absolutely loads of memory: over a GB is not
                startling.  Almost all those nodes will be duplicates of other parts of the tree and almost all possible
                children will exist.  So we really want to get the memory usage down if we want to avoid our program
                waiting on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832" target="_blank">main memory</a>
                all the time: bottom cache is typically in the tens of nanoseconds away, whereas main memory is around a
                hundred nanoseconds away.  Getting the GADDAG small enough to fit into cache, even the bottom level
                cache (as in slowest and biggest), can mean an order of magnitude speedup!  So its well worth
                compressing your GADDAG.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/downloads/faster-scrabble-gordon.pdf" target="_blank">original
                paper</a> describes compression and gives an example of partial compression.  I will talk these
                through with graphs:</p>
                <p><img alt="image" data-orig-height="518" data-orig-width="500" src="media/old/87682811573_1.png"/></p>

                <p>Here’s the uncompressed tree.  Sorry it takes so much screen space .. it has a lot of
                nodes in it, which is a point I want to make :)</p>
                <p>3 words, 11 rotations and 27 nodes.</p>
                <p>Lets start compressing it:</p>
                <p>The first thing to note is that, unlike the ALL, BALL, CALL <a href="https://nullwords.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/gaddag-data-structure/" target="_blank">example</a> on
                NullWords blog, I am storing the terminating characters (the blue nodes) in a separate set off the node.
                 This is how the prefix LLA is followed by a single node with both B and C in it.</p>
