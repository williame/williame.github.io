<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>After a xmas break - guests do get in the way - it was time to get back to the
                robot!</p>
                <p>To be honest I’ve been putting off etching the motor controller card.  I really don’t
                like the whole idea of playing around with acid and stuff.  My recollections of etching (with crayons)
                from high-school are vague at best so I’m a rank beginner.</p>
                <p>The UV lightbox was, well, a desk lamp with the UV bulb.  Its not at all like the sun-tanning
                beds you see in the pictures.  I pointed it roughly in the direction of the board, and put a
                kitchen-foil-lined box over it to keep me safe.</p>
                <p>My first attempts were a dismal failure.  After 10 minutes exposure there were faint lines
                visible after I put it through 10 minutes of developer.  I didn’t know if this was normal or
                otherwise, so it was onwards to the acid.  Nothing at all came off.  Nothing.  Hmm.  I speculated that
                it was underexposed.</p>
                <p>Back under the light for half an hour, moving the light around slightly a couple of times to
                even it out, and the mask was much more prominent.  Clearly the 3-10 minute guidelines were based on
                fancy light boxes with neat racks of UV tubes :)</p>
                <p>It was very exciting to see the circuit appear after just a few minutes in the acid the second
                time.  However, after a good half hour there was still no budging some copper along to the top edge of
                the board.  I speculate that it was underexposed by the unevenness of my lamp coverage.</p>
                <p>We have a spare board but I’m out of acid.  I think this board can be scratched into
                shape so I’ll try and get it used.</p>
                <p>Now I’ll hand over the card for my co-conspirator to tidy, drill and solder and test.</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>Another Wednesday, another trip to the ‘office’ to meet my<br/>
                co-conspirators and go robot supplies shopping.<br/><br/> It didn’t quite go as
                planned with the ironing-on masking approach;<br/> sadly our nearby shop that sells board and such
                - Kjell&amp;Co - has<br/> stopped stocking the plain copper ones and now only the UV-sensitive<br/>
                ones are available.  And it seemed a shame to have to clean off the UV<br/> layer and iron-on our
                mask, so we opted to splash out on a UV lamp<br/> instead.  We also got the acid, developer and
                other bits and pieces<br/> like lunch-boxes to put the acid in and so on.<br/><br/> We
                printed the mask out onto overhead film.  Two copies, to make sure<br/> its definitely dark
                enough.<br/><br/> The plan is to make the some simple test exposures to get the timing<br/>
                right and such, and then develop the H-bridge board.  Once that’s been<br/> soldered and
                is controlling some simple lamps it’ll be time to think<br/> about joining our ARM chip
                board to it.<br/><br/> Its going to be a smelly weekend with the acid</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>We finally might have found some paper we can use to transfer laser<br/> toner
                to PCBs!<br/><br/> We’ve been exhaustively testing various glossy magazine and
                brochures<br/> and things and its proved hard to find paper that feeds properly<br/> through
                our printer; we’ve had the printer apart in ways you won’t<br/> find in the
                handbook trying to find missing incriminating pages.<br/><br/> Taping these pages to proper
                A4 paper in the hope it’d feed better<br/> turned out to be a big mistake.  Massive
                mistake.  But the printer<br/> works again now so that’ll be our secret.<br/><br/>
                The only success we’ve had is to print out the mask onto some 15yo<br/> deskjet photo
                paper and quickly iron it onto the board.  Then we soak<br/> it for a few minutes in water and
                then rub the paper off with our<br/> thumbs.  We’ve been testing with normal kitchen
                foil, and hope that it<br/> works as well on proper board.<br/><br/> There are people
                on the internet who claim to have adapted laser<br/> printers to feed flat sheet PCB through
                directly, and then they chuck<br/> it in a warm oven for a few minutes to ensure its properly
                fused.  We<br/> had started to think along those lines, although I rather imagine a<br/>
                lego mindstorms printer - or laser etcher - being a more fun build<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX09WnGU6ZY" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX09WnGU6ZY</a>
                .  Of course a proper UV<br/> light box would be easier that that route.<br/><br/>
                Ironing seems strangely pleasingly amateurish.</p>
