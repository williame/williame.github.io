</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>I’ve added an interactive Perlin “Noise explorer” to
                <a href="https://williame.github.io/barebones.js/" target="_blank">barebones.js</a>.</p>
                <p>I had originally used the usual Simplex Noise Javascript port that is in <a alt="dead link: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/SimplexNoise.js" href="/#404" target="_blank">three.js</a>
                and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>I even ported - successfully - to asm.js!  FWIW, asm.js turned out to be much slower than the
                normal code; this isn’t code that benefits from being ported, it seems; the call overhead is
                quite high.  If you want a lot of noise, e.g. generate a 2D or 3D array in one go, then the asm.js might
                be much faster if the loop is inside asm.js, but as it was - for single samples - it was so much slower
                I abandoned it.</p>
                <p>I didn’t enjoy debugging my port to asm.js and I find all the coercion ugly, but it
                was trivially learnable and may be interesting yet e.g. spatial indices and priority queue heaps.</p>
                <p>But ultimately I wasn’t happy with the tunability of the Simplex Noise
                implementation.  So I instead set about making a very naive reimplementation of Ken Perlin’s
                <a href="https://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/doc/oscar.html#noise" target="_blank">classic C noise</a>
                in Javascript.</p>
                <p>This lets you set the number of octaves and the alpha and beta values for bumpiness (sometimes
                called persistence).  If you set the scale attribute manually you can even control the scaling of the
                component samples!</p>
                <p>It doubtless runs slower but, for reasonably small chunks of work its more than fast enough. 
                And barebones.js has a cool web-worker wrapper if you want to generate big chunks of noise
                asynchronously.</p>
                <p>I didn’t pay too much attention to GLSL noise - that’s applicable for
                rendering, but not so useful for generating game levels and so on where you really need your noise
                accessible to Javascript (and in webGL you can’t read back framebuffers).</p>
                <p>As a thought-experiment it ought to be possible to do a <a href="https://www.fractalforums.com/general-discussion-b77/distance-estimator-for-perlin-noise/msg64073/#msg64073" target="_blank">distance estimator </a>for Perlin Noise at any threshold.  This would help me
                shadow my visualisation nicely, but it would have rather more general advantages if it sped up making
                big chunks of noise too?</p>

                editors existed.  So I made one.  Will’s Voxel Editor, as it was called, was hugely popular in
                the limited world of Tiberian Sun modding.  I worked closely with a modder called Mr War - all modders

                <p>Williams Edwards writes a wonderful, slow lingering tale of <a href="post/53349845356.html">Scaling my Server</a> through
                a series of rewrites to create a system that effortlessly maintains millions and millions of active
                users. The article is packed with goodness, but the result was to write in Java, use a central shardable
                server to push messages to devices, scale proportional to active users not total users, keep live data
                in RAM persist in a database, version the DB, use application level message ACKs, use
                DataInput/OutputStreams, use a faster JSON parser, there’s a  limit to the number of TLS
                connections can terminate, Java data types have a lot of overhead which limits the number you can keep
                in RAM, Java hashtables are wasteful. [<a alt="dead link: http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/6/21/stuff-the-internet-says-on-scalability-for-june-21-2013.html" href="/#404" target="_blank">src</a>]</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><a href="post/53349845356.html" target="_blank">Previously</a>, I described how I tried to do the simplest possible thing that
                might work and <em>didn’t</em> get away with it.  The story got some attention and
                a couple of interesting points and ideas were raised:</p>
                <p><strong>Doing it wrong</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                <div>This is a lot of words for “I needed message queues and keep doing it wrong”

                </blockquote>
                <p>Ooooh cheap shot, love it!  I’d be the first to raise such an objection but on deeper
                inspection I begin to wonder what we all mean by this bit of wisdom.  There’s a <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2011/5-subtle-ways-youre-using-mysql-as-a-queue-and-why-itll-bite-you" target="_blank">nice article</a> on it, but the alternatives really aren’t there as I
                see it; you’re stuck trying to find a queue server that is transactioned, can be queried and
                edited and has secondary indices and can do it with millions upon millions of <em>persistent</em>
                queues.</p>
                <p>If someone said that your Orders and OrderRows tables should instead be a queue per order you’d
                check their surroundings for sharp objects ;)</p>
                <p><strong>Golang</strong></p>
                <p>Quite a lot of people suggested Go for my next rewrite.  You know, I had exactly the same idea
                when I started the last rewrite and I reviewed it then.</p>
                <p>Go hadn’t reached 1.0 then but it was definitely the kind of language I like, even if
                I don’t like the syntax much.  But the big blocker was interning strings; in Go there isn’t
                a good way of making a caching system to de-dupe strings (perhaps reference counting would be needed and
                it’d be error-prone).  Worse, its one of those subjects where it seems most of the go-nuts
                crowd are completely small-picture people :(  Its unlikely to turn up soon, and without de-dupe we can’t
                fit the “PromotionCode1” group ID in RAM for each and every device.  This single
                issue was a no-go for me.</p>
                <p>But I do like Go, and hope to use it for real real soon…</p>
                <p><strong>But cool!</strong></p>
                <p>Writing about the scaling experience, and carefully reading everyone’s ideas and
                criticisms of it and trying to put myself in their position and see what they see has been really
                eye-opening.  I need to clean up my writing style!  Its been really fun to get so much feedback, and so
                much positive feedback too!  Thank you all, and I’ll keep you updated…</p>

                <p>At the beginning of the <a alt="dead link: http://www.mblox.com/" href="/#404" target="_blank">project</a>
                to build a large-scale targeted multi-recipient messaging server, I opted to use the simplest, most
                mainstream architecture possible: put everything in a RDBMS and let each web handler run queries.</p>
                <p>It is a bit like push email but with groups and you can edit and recall messages even after
                they are sent and you can schedule them and you can even make complex expressions to determine who gets
                the message and so on.  And it had to be an online system rather than a batch system.  All in all, quite
                a complex bit of software.</p>
                <p>I had just finished a project making a transcoding and multi-casting video server that involved
                getting deep and dirty with edge-triggered asynchronous IO in C++ (the server got open-sourced as <a href="post/18200335569.html" target="_blank">hellepoll</a>
                afterwards), so I really was keen to <em>avoid</em> exactly that type of high-complexity
                solution.  I didn’t think this new project warranted it.</p>
                <p>So I opted for Python (it aligned with other teams in the company and to be honest I was
                willingly forced into using it) with Twisted (as Tornado was at the time very evolutionary and didn’t
                have all the utility DB stuff and so on).  I opted for MySQL too (as that was already in use in the
                company and that simplified the deploy story).</p>

                nor write English yet I am often flabbergasted at their proficiency.</p>
                <p>I think its time to give them a computer with internet access and perhaps start trying to send
                them down a programming path too.</p>
                <p>My eldest daughter, at 7, is very inventive and is currently planning a flying car.  For real.
                 Of course I’m sure she understands its just fun to plan, but plan she does.  Its full of
                little innovations like a bin between the seats so you can throw away sandwiches and things you don’t
                like and then the motor itself will be driven by rubbish.  This is after a discussion at school about
                recycling, of course.  You can tell I’m a very proud dad :)  We’ve just spent a week
                collecting pictures of double-decker buses and things getting stuck under bridges in an attempt to
                determine how high they can be…</p>
                <p>She is already giving me lots of advice on my city building game, and has recently petitioned
                for bridges and tunnels.  Its really exciting to listen to her describe the cities we could build…</p>
                <p>I want to foster this curiosity by leading her towards programming too.  I think of programming

                <p>When run on local-host, the game runs four sims at once, in lock-step.  Three of them are test
                patterns, and the top left is for playing around.</p>
                <p>This makes it very easy to try out and tweak algorithms!</p>
                <p>The top-left layout - residential is red, industrial is pink and commercial blue - is supposed
                to be fairly optimal.  I want the algorithm to favour it, which you can see at the moment it does!</p>
                <p>The bottom left has more space between the zones, and road only on one side.  The algorithm
                should favour growth near the road, and at the moment it does!</p>
                <p>The bottom right is a very sub-optimal layout and I want the algorithm to punish it.
                 Commercial and industrial don’t like each other (although the commercial cares more than the
                industrial).</p>
                <p>The early sims are quite pleasing, but after a while - just a few years since my whole timeline
                thing is not quite set up - things get out of whack and success breeds success and it becomes a run-away
                chain reaction.  I need to think about levelling and damping and so on.</p>
                <p>I’ve been talking to the <a href="http://www.opencity.info/" target="_blank">OpenCity</a>
                devs and the way their algorithm works is:</p>
                <ol><li>each sim step, pick a random residential, commercial or industrial zone to re-score.
                 It doesn’t recompute the scores for all zones each time step.  Change is gradual.</li>
                <li>in a NxN grid, see if there are any of the other two zone types</li>
                <li>depending on the zone type, reward or penalise nearby other zone types</li>
                <li>if the reward is positive, there’s a small chance that the zone will level up</li>
                <li>if the reward is negative, there’s a small chance that the zone will level down</li>
                </ol><p>I have a slightly more computationally-expensive approach, although far from the
                simple balance in OpenCity:</p>
                <ol><li>each sim step, pick between 1 and N% of the RCI zones are re-scored</li>
                <li>for each re-scoring zone,</li>
                <li>perform a best-first search to determine all the other zones within reach</li>
                <li>the transport cost uses one of three transport cost layers - car_and_foot, bus and train.  The
                best-first search can jump between these layers at bus stops and train stations</li>
                <li>at this point I have a list of nearby zones for each type and how far it is away and its score
                and so on; a quite complicated and nuanced algorithm could use all this data.  For now, we do something
                rather simple:</li>
                <li>average the distance*score of each nearby zone type</li>
                <li>if the zone is residential, re-score = commerical_score + industrial_score +
                residential_score*0.1</li>
                <li>if the zone is commercial, re-score = residential_score - industrial_score +
                commercial_score*0.1</li>
                <li>and so on</li>
                <li>then, if the re-score is more than the current score, there’s a 25% probability that
                5% of the difference is added to the zone’s score</li>
                <li>and inverse for re-scoring down</li>
                <li>with some basic clamping</li>
                </ol>

</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p><a href="http://asmjs.org/" target="_blank">asm.js</a> leaves me
                divided.  I agree to a large extent with <a alt="dead link: http://mrale.ph/blog/2013/03/28/why-asmjs-bothers-me.html" href="/#404" target="_blank">this old V8 coder</a>.</p>
                <p>I care a lot about pure Javascript performance.  A recent project had me making a web worker
                that had to do lots of path finding.  And no matter how fast your priority queue implementation is, it
                isn’t fast enough.</p>
                <p>I’ve been basing my priority queue on <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/appendix2.html" target="_blank">this one</a>.  The hottest
                function is the scoring function; its not a big function - <code>function(a,b) { return a[0] &lt;
                b[0]; }</code> - but its called a lot.</p>
                <p>In my problem domain the maximum size of the queue is bounded by the size of the board and the
                objects I want to prioritise can be expressed as a list of integers and the prioritisation can be based
                on the comparison of the first element in each slot.</p>
                <p>So you could imagine an asm.js priority queue that used an Int32Array view (tidier if you could
                use an Int16Array in my case but coercion to ints is a 32bit thing) of its heap and exposed push and pop
                methods.</p>
                <p>But the problem became how the push and pop signatures would work and how to generalise it. 
                The functions have to take numbers and return numbers.  I ended up imagining having to reserve some part
                of the heap for passing in and out the values and writing a non-asm.js wrapper that keeps the heap and
                the priority queue code internally and does the wrapping unwrapping in non-asm.js code at non-asm.js
                speed.</p>
                <p>Altogether I wish that asm.js wasn’t so extraordinarily narrow.  I want it to read
                and write objects, and be more of a Cython-for-Javascript.</p>
                <p>And then I want actually for a tool that highlights your type-determined-local-variable code
                that the Javascript runtime can make optimise, so I can move more and more code in the fast path into
                this implicitly-but-statically-typed subset.  And this is tooling, and <em>doesn’t</em>
                need asm.js.</p>
                <p>Being told the |0 and such tricks is just frustrating.  Its saying that if you write code thats
                hard and verbose for humans to understand and correct, the compiler has it easy.  Its pushing for me to
                write my stuff in something I can emscripten into an unreadable tangle of Javascript, rather than
                writing fast Javascript by hand.</p>
                <p>Javascript has lots of issues.  From a performance aspect it has the albatross of dynamic
                typing and late binding meaning lots of checks and hash tables (although lack of threads can help make
                things better than Python blah blah).  Asm.js isn’t really addressing any of this.</p>
                <p>I want colour-coding in Firebug so I can see profiling information in the sourcecode rather
                than in profiler reports and I want coloured annotations so I can see all the inferred properties -
                constness, data types, cacheability etc - of my code and strive to optimise as humans can.</p>
                <p>I want tools and a generic Javascript runtime that can infer what asm.js wants the coder to
                specify.</p>

</a>
<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>I was playing the other month with making flame particle effects.  Lots of flame
                particle effects:</p>
                <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="256" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Em5gSVgKsBI?rel=0" width="341"> </iframe></p>
                <p>The challenge - in webGL - is to minimise the data transfer per frame.  So I created my flame
                effects procedurally using a random seed.</p>
                <p>I claim no invention nor credit; I based this upon a million Google searches and nothing I’ve
                done is unique; but is novel and fun for me so I share.</p>
                <p>What I did was create a single big VBO of random numbers.  I never updated this list of random
                numbers; I just kept re-using it.  Its an immutable list.  The list is as long as the maximum number of
                particles in any system.</p>
                <p>Then for each particle system I created a unique random number for it.  And a few other things
                like its position and size.</p>
                <p>To draw each system I computed the matrix so that, in its model coordinates, it was always
                drawing inside a -1,-1 -&gt; 1,1 square.   That just simplifies life inside the shaders.</p>
                <p>In vertex shader I use the per-system random number uniform combined with the per-vertex random
                number attribute to seed a random number generator to derive the particle’s attributes e.g.
                size, start-position, direction, colour etc.  I then had a uniform float ‘time’
                passed to determine the frame of animation to draw.</p>
                <p>In this way I could have lots - easily filling the whole screen with tens of thousands - of
                point-sprite-based fire particles and no two systems looked identical!</p>

<?xml version="1.0" ?><post-body><p>Previously: <em><a href="post/42912076785.html" target="_blank">Why
                is Ruby bad security?</a></em></p>
                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Ruby libraries need to stop being too powerful.</li>
                <li>Programmers need to understand the libraries they are using.</li>
                </ul><hr/><p>So, lets recap on the recent Ruby on Rails security woes.  For some
                non-obvious reason, Ruby on Rails supported YAML form parameters.</p>
                <p>And it turned out that the Ruby YAML parser can … instantiate complex objects.</p>
                <p>Why can the Ruby YAML parser instantiate complex objects, and why did the YAML author <a href="https://github.com/tenderlove/psych/issues/119" target="_blank">not see</a> this as a
                problem?</p>
                <p>So we swatted that bug; we stopped Rails allowing YAML.</p>
                <p><em>Only it then turns out</em> that Rails also supported XML form parameters.</p>
                <p>Now there are lots of nasty attacks against XML parsers like recursive entities and external
                entities and ways of DOSing the server; but that’s no different from attacking the hash-table
                used to store form parameters, I guess.</p>
                <p>The nasty thing about the <em>Ruby</em> XML parser is that it can embed YAML.</p>
                <p>Why can the XML parser embed YAML?</p>

                instantiate complex objects.  Not all the flaws can be blamed on over-ambition of the serialisation
                libraries like YAML and now JSON, though.  There was a spate of <a alt="dead link: http://blog.mhartl.com/2008/09/21/mass-assignment-in-rails-applications/" href="/#404" target="_blank">mass-assignment
                </a>vulnerabilities and others and doubtless some I’ve forgotten.</p>
                <p><em><strong>update</strong></em>: I spoke too soon: there’s
                <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/AFBKNY7VSH8" target="_blank">yet another</a> assignment vulnerability right now, again….</p>
                <p>Why, deep down, does Ruby have whack-a-mole security problems?  I don’t by the
                popularity argument at all; its not because Rails has suddenly become a big enough target to encourage
                attackers.</p>
                <p>I think its much deeper in the Ruby psyche.</p>
                <p>Why <em>doesn’t</em> the Python JSON serialiser try and instantiate
                non-standard data-types?</p>
                <p><strong>Ruby delights in spooky action at a distance</strong>.  Rubyists and
                Railites delights in an perverse, extreme object-orientation.  In Convention-over-configuration and Don’t-Repeat-Yourself
                mantras.</p>
                <p>The aim is to be so declarative, so high-level as to no longer see nor understand what is
                happening beneath and before.</p>
                <p>Even Python apps are much shallower than Ruby apps.  Ruby is the queen of indirection and
                nesting.</p>
                <p>I just can’t see Go and Python frameworks suffering in the same way and to such a
                large endemic extent.</p>

                <p>Opening myself up here, but to be honest I’m deeply disappointed about our Ludum Dare
                game-making-contest score history. I expected more of us; we aimed higher, and we hoped to make
                something that would please and wow the crowd.</p>
                <p><img alt="" height="307" src="https://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/10313-shot0.png" width="617"/></p>
                <p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&amp;uid=10313" target="_blank">And we abjectly failed, again.</a></p>
                <p>We’ve always aimed to challenge norms; in <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&amp;uid=10313" target="_blank">LD23</a>
                we’d tried to put graphics into text adventures in an interesting, new way. We’ve tried to enter a
                multi-player on-line game in <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&amp;uid=10313" target="_blank">LD24</a>, and we’ve tried in <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&amp;uid=10313" target="_blank">LD25</a>
                to make a 2D platform game without tiles.</p>
                <p><em><strong>We really are overactive underachievers.</strong></em></p>
                <p>Our highest LD25 score was for music. We were perhaps not clear enough that that was the one
                thing we had not ourselves made <img alt=":(" src="https://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/> It was a track we’d
                picked up on the Internet, and we thought we’d explained that.</p>
                <p>So why did we fail so miserably? <strong>Bad control.</strong>  We should have had
                a lot more and we lacked in plenty of areas, but I think that the playability was most affected by the
                bad control.</p>
                <p>Its fairly non-trivial to do collision with arbitrary lines and so on, and do it efficiently
                too. Our collision code, which we’d written for the game and mostly as the deadline loomed, was immature
                and incomplete. We should of course have learned how to code it before the jam, or borrowed a library or
                something.  But we’re not really borrowing-code-libraries kind-of-people.</p>
                <p>And what happens is that you do badly in a core area such as control and people voting just
                give you a low score across the board. We got 1.92 for innovation which just means we hid the code well
                I guess.</p>
                <p>I’m deeply saddened that we didn’t score higher for graphics, as I myself am in awe of my
                team-mate’s artistic prowess and thing it deserved more. A very big part of that is my fault, as I also
                didn’t get around to good GLSL lighting. Meaning the whole making the scene out of meshes thing didn’t
                work, and it was hard to see where the platforms were because of the uniform shading.</p>
                <p>In previous LDs the winners have always wowed me. I’ve always looked down the winners list and
                been awed and inspired. This time its been a whole lot, well, distanced. I don’t mean to take anything
                from the winners and everyone else in on the game; I think its in a large part because I didn’t find the
                theme exciting.</p>
                <p>We had had an alternative game that was a FarmRomanVilla thing; Zynga being villains and
                villain being a medieval French word for farm worker and all. All actually inspired by a recent episode
                of Time Team I’d watched where they excavated a Roman villa in Britain…  But whilst that was very much
                the kind of game I like making, I think it would have disappointed just as badly as the
                lets-make-a-platform-game,-they-always-do-well game that we tried.</p>
                <p>Its been a introspective start to the new year. Our strength is art and we do ok-ish at coding
                too, but general story and game-play, audio (we’re both terribly untalented musically) and overarching
                fun we fail miserably at.</p>
                <p>I know I’m supposed to end on a high note of future optimism and enthusiasm and a promise to
                try harder and come back next time. But its hard to muster the bravado. Time heals, so maybe we’ll be
                back for another beating; we’ll see.</p>

                <p>To think we made all this in just 72 hours?!</p>
                <p>The theme for the competition was “<em>you are the villain</em>”.</p>
                <p>We wanted to make a game that my young daughters could (be allowed to) play, which meant no
                blood and guts and swearing etc.  It had to be tame, innocent fun.  We settled on a very classic
                platform-game idea.  If you ‘die’, you actually go to prison.  Being cast as the
                baddie doesn’t mean you become a goodie, not when its made by a prudish dad like me!</p>
                <p>The artwork is excellent as usual, due entirely to my co-conspirator, the <a href="post/37291851878.html" target="_blank">usual suspect</a>.  The general engine - which I coded - whilst cool in that I
                made it from scratch, is not so great.</p>
                <p>If there’s a criticism of the game-play its the wrong-feeling control system.</p>

                <p>We struggled a bit with this year’s theme: You are the villain</p>
                <p>We really wanted to make something my daughters can play, and I don’t really like the
                baddies winning out.</p>
                <p>In the end we decided to pretty much make a nice little tame platform game, and pay little
                attention to the theme.</p>
                <p>As usual, I’ve written thousands of lines of tooling code, and almost no game code! 
                Our artist, on the other hand, has made gazillions of assets at his usual unbelievable pace.</p>

                <p>This time its written in Javascript.  The neatest thing is that our artist is able to edit
